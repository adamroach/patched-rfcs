Abstract

   This document specifies the algorithm for wrapping one Triple-DES key
   with another Triple-DES key and the algorithm for wrapping one RC2
   key with another RC2 key.  These key wrap algorithms were originally
   published in section 12.6 of RFC 2630.  They are republished since
   these key wrap algorithms have been found to be useful in contexts
   beyond those supported by RFC 2630.

1  Introduction

   Management of symmetric cryptographic keys often leads to situations
   where one symmetric key is used to encrypt (or wrap) another.  Key
   wrap algorithms are commonly used in two situations.  First, key
   agreement algorithms (such as Diffie-Hellman [DH-X9.42]) generate a
   pairwise key-encryption key, and a key wrap algorithm is used to
   encrypt the content-encryption key or a multicast key with the
   pairwise key-encryption key.  Second, a key wrap algorithm is used to
   encrypt the content-encryption key, multicast key, or session key in
   a locally generated storage key-encryption key or a key-encryption
   key that was distributed out-of-band.

   This document specifies the algorithm for wrapping one Triple-DES key
   with another Triple-DES key [3DES], and it specifies the algorithm
   for wrapping one RC2 key with another RC2 key [RC2].  Encryption of a
   Triple-DES key with another Triple-DES key uses the algorithm
   specified in section 3.  Encryption of a RC2 key with another RC2 key
   uses the algorithm specified in section 4.  Both of these algorithms
   rely on the key checksum algorithm specified in section 2.  Triple-
   DES and RC2 content-encryption keys are encrypted in Cipher Block
   Chaining (CBC) mode [MODES].

   In this document, the key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, and MAY are to be interpreted as described
   by Scott Bradner in [STDWORDS].

2  Key Checksum

   The key checksum algorithm is used to provide a key integrity check
   value.  The algorithm is:

   1. Compute a 20 octet SHA-1 [SHA1] message digest on the key that is
      to be wrapped.
   2. Use the most significant (first) eight octets of the message
      digest value as the checksum value.

3  Triple-DES Key Wrapping and Unwrapping

   This section specifies the algorithms for wrapping and unwrapping one
   Triple-DES key with another Triple-DES key [3DES].

   The same key wrap algorithm is used for both Two-key Triple-DES and
   Three-key Triple-DES keys.  When a Two-key Triple-DES key is to be
   wrapped, a third DES key with the same value as the first DES key is
   created.  Thus, all wrapped Triple-DES keys include three DES keys.
   However, a Two-key Triple-DES key MUST NOT be used to wrap a Three-
   key Triple-DES key that is comprised of three unique DES keys.

3.1  Triple-DES Key Wrap

   The Triple-DES key wrap algorithm encrypts a Triple-DES key with a
   Triple-DES key-encryption key.  The Triple-DES key wrap algorithm is:

   1. Set odd parity for each of the DES key octets comprising the
      Three-Key Triple-DES key that is to be wrapped, call the result
      CEK.
   2. Compute an 8 octet key checksum value on CEK as described above in
      Section 2, call the result ICV.
   3. Let CEKICV = CEK || ICV.
   4. Generate 8 octets at random, call the result IV.
   5. Encrypt CEKICV in CBC mode using the key-encryption key.  Use the
      random value generated in the previous step as the initialization
      vector (IV).  Call the ciphertext TEMP1.
   6. Let TEMP2 = IV || TEMP1.
   7. Reverse the order of the octets in TEMP2.  That is, the most
      significant (first) octet is swapped with the least significant
      (last) octet, and so on.  Call the result TEMP3.
   8. Encrypt TEMP3 in CBC mode using the key-encryption key.  Use an
      initialization vector (IV) of 0x4adda22c79e82105.  The ciphertext
      is 40 octets long.

RFC 3217            Triple-DES and RC2 Key Wrapping        December 2001


   Note:  When the same Three-Key Triple-DES key is wrapped in different
   key-encryption keys, a fresh initialization vector (IV) must be
   generated for each invocation of the key wrap algorithm.

3.2  Triple-DES Key Unwrap

   The Triple-DES key unwrap algorithm decrypts a Triple-DES key using a
   Triple-DES key-encryption key.  The Triple-DES key unwrap algorithm
   is:

   1. If the wrapped key is not 40 octets, then error.
   2. Decrypt the wrapped key in CBC mode using the key-encryption key.
      Use an initialization vector (IV) of 0x4adda22c79e82105.  Call the
      output TEMP3.
   3. Reverse the order of the octets in TEMP3.  That is, the most
      significant (first) octet is swapped with the least significant
      (last) octet, and so on.  Call the result TEMP2.
   4. Decompose TEMP2 into IV and TEMP1.  IV is the most significant
      (first) 8 octets, and TEMP1 is the least significant (last) 32
      octets.
   5. Decrypt TEMP1 in CBC mode using the key-encryption key.  Use the
      IV value from the previous step as the initialization vector.
      Call the ciphertext CEKICV.
   6. Decompose CEKICV into CEK and ICV.  CEK is the most significant
      (first) 24 octets, and ICV is the least significant (last) 8
      octets.
   7. Compute an 8 octet key checksum value on CEK as described above in
      Section 2.  If the computed key checksum value does not match the
      decrypted key checksum value, ICV, then error.
   8. Check for odd parity each of the DES key octets comprising CEK.
      If parity is incorrect, then error.
   9. Use CEK as a Triple-DES key.

3.3  Triple-DES Key Wrap Algorithm Identifier

   Some security protocols employ ASN.1 [X.208-88, X.209-88], and these
   protocols employ algorithm identifiers to name cryptographic
   algorithms.  To support these protocols, the Triple-DES key wrap
   algorithm has been assigned the following algorithm identifier:

      id-alg-CMS3DESwrap OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
         us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16) alg(3) 6 }

   The AlgorithmIdentifier parameter field MUST be NULL.

4  RC2 Key Wrapping and Unwrapping

   This section specifies the algorithms for wrapping and unwrapping one
   RC2 key with another RC2 key [RC2].

   RC2 supports variable length keys.  RC2 128-bit keys MUST be used as
   key-encryption keys; however, the wrapped RC2 key MAY be of any size.

4.1  RC2 Key Wrap

   The RC2 key wrap algorithm encrypts a RC2 key with a RC2 key-
   encryption key.  The RC2 key wrap algorithm is:

   1.  Let the RC2 key be called CEK, and let the length of CEK in
       octets be called LENGTH.  LENGTH is a single octet.
   2.  Let LCEK = LENGTH || CEK.
   3.  Let LCEKPAD = LCEK || PAD.  If the length of LCEK is a multiple
       of 8, the PAD has a length of zero.  If the length of LCEK is not
       a multiple of 8, then PAD contains the fewest number of random
       octets to make the length of LCEKPAD a multiple of 8.
   4.  Compute an 8 octet key checksum value on LCEKPAD as described
       above in Section 2, call the result ICV.
   5.  Let LCEKPADICV = LCEKPAD || ICV.
   6.  Generate 8 octets at random, call the result IV.
   7.  Encrypt LCEKPADICV in CBC mode using the key-encryption key.  Use
       the random value generated in the previous step as the
       initialization vector (IV).  Call the ciphertext TEMP1.

RFC 3217            Triple-DES and RC2 Key Wrapping        December 2001


   8.  Let TEMP2 = IV || TEMP1.
   9.  Reverse the order of the octets in TEMP2.  That is, the most
       significant (first) octet is swapped with the least significant
       (last) octet, and so on.  Call the result TEMP3.
   10. Encrypt TEMP3 in CBC mode using the key-encryption key.  Use an
       initialization vector (IV) of 0x4adda22c79e82105.

   Note:  When the same RC2 key is wrapped in different key-encryption
   keys, a fresh initialization vector (IV) must be generated for each
   invocation of the key wrap algorithm.

4.2  RC2 Key Unwrap

   The RC2 key unwrap algorithm decrypts a RC2 key using a RC2 key-
   encryption key.  The RC2 key unwrap algorithm is:

   1.  If the wrapped key is not a multiple of 8 octets, then error.
   2.  Decrypt the wrapped key in CBC mode using the key-encryption key.
       Use an initialization vector (IV) of 0x4adda22c79e82105.  Call
       the output TEMP3.
   3.  Reverse the order of the octets in TEMP3.  That is, the most
       significant (first) octet is swapped with the least significant
       (last) octet, and so on.  Call the result TEMP2.
   4.  Decompose the TEMP2 into IV and TEMP1.  IV is the most
       significant (first) 8 octets, and TEMP1 is the remaining octets.
   5.  Decrypt TEMP1 in CBC mode using the key-encryption key.  Use the
       IV value from the previous step as the initialization vector.
       Call the plaintext LCEKPADICV.
   6.  Decompose the LCEKPADICV into LCEKPAD, and ICV.  ICV is the least
       significant (last) octet 8 octets.  LCEKPAD is the remaining
       octets.
   7.  Compute an 8 octet key checksum value on LCEKPAD as described
       above in Section 2.  If the computed key checksum value does not
       match the decrypted key checksum value, ICV, then error.
   8.  Decompose the LCEKPAD into LENGTH, CEK, and PAD.  LENGTH is the
       most significant (first) octet.  CEK is the following LENGTH
       octets.  PAD is the remaining octets, if any.
   9.  If the length of PAD is more than 7 octets, then error.
   10. Use CEK as an RC2 key.

4.3  RC2 Key Wrap Algorithm Identifier

   Some security protocols employ ASN.1 [X.208-88, X.209-88], and these
   protocols employ algorithm identifiers to name cryptographic
   algorithms.  To support these protocols, the RC2 key wrap algorithm
   has been assigned the following algorithm identifier:

RFC 3217            Triple-DES and RC2 Key Wrapping        December 2001


      id-alg-CMSRC2wrap OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
         us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16) alg(3) 7 }

   The AlgorithmIdentifier parameter field MUST be RC2wrapParameter:

      RC2wrapParameter ::= RC2ParameterVersion

      RC2ParameterVersion ::= INTEGER

   The RC2 effective-key-bits (key size) greater than 32 and less than
   256 is encoded in the RC2ParameterVersion.  For the effective-key-
   bits of 40, 64, and 128, the rc2ParameterVersion values are 160, 120,
   and 58 respectively.  These values are not simply the RC2 key length.
   Note that the value 160 must be encoded as two octets (00 A0),
   because the one octet (A0) encoding represents a negative number.

The text is silent about the RC2 parameter that indicates the effective key size.  This errata resolves the ambiguity.

To aid implementors, this errata includes two examples.  The first one matches section 4.4 and uses a 40-bit effective key size.  The second one uses a 128-bit effective key size.  Many thanks to Peter Yee for generating the examples and Blake Ramsdell for checking them.

RFC 3217            Triple-DES and RC2 Key Wrapping        December 2001


6  Security Considerations

   Implementations must protect the key-encryption key.  Compromise of
   the key-encryption key may result in the disclosure of all keys that
   have been wrapped with the key-encryption key, which may lead to the
   disclosure of all traffic protected with those wrapped key.

   Implementations must randomly generate initialization vectors (IVs)
   and padding.  The generation of quality random numbers is difficult.
   RFC 1750 [RANDOM] offers important guidance in this area, and
   Appendix 3 of FIPS Pub 186 [DSS] provides one quality PRNG technique.

   If the key-encryption key and wrapped key are associated with
   different symmetric encryption algorithms, the effective security
   provided to data encrypted with the wrapped key is determined by the
   weaker of the two algorithms.  If, for example, data is encrypted
   with 168-bit Triple-DES and that Triple-DES key is wrapped with a
   40-bit RC2 key, then at most 40 bits of protection is provided.  A
   trivial search to determine the value of the 40-bit RC2 key can
   recover Triple-DES key, and then the Triple-DES key can be used to
   decrypt the content.  Therefore, implementers must ensure that key-
   encryption algorithms are as strong or stronger than content-
   encryption algorithms.

   These key wrap algorithms specified in this document have been
   reviewed for use with Triple-DES and RC2, and they have not been
   reviewed for use with other encryption algorithms.  Similarly, the
   key wrap algorithms make use of CBC mode [MODES], and they have not
   been reviewed for use with other cryptographic modes.
