RFC 5724                    sms&quot; URI Scheme                 January 2010


1.  Introduction

1.1.  What is GSM?

   GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) is a digital mobile
   phone standard that is used extensively in many parts of the world.
   First named after its frequency band around 900 MHz, GSM-900 has
   provided the basis for several other networks utilizing GSM
   technology, in particular, GSM networks operating in the frequency
   bands around 1800 MHz and 1900 MHz.  When referring to &quot;GSM&quot; in this
   document, we mean any of these GSM-based networks that operate a
   short message service.

1.2.  What is SMS?

   The Short Message Service (SMS) [SMS] is an integral part of the GSM
   network technology.  It has been very successful and currently is a
   major source of revenue for many GSM operators.  SMS as a service is
   so successful that other Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN)
   technologies have adopted it as well, in particular, the Integrated
   Services Digital Network (ISDN).  Because of this development, this
   memo uses the term &quot;SMS client&quot; to refer to user agents that are able
   to send and/or receive SMS messages.

1.2.1.  SMS Content

   GSM SMS messages are alphanumeric paging messages that can be sent to
   and from SMS clients.  SMS messages have a maximum length of 160
   characters (7-bit characters from the GSM character set [SMS-CHAR]),
   or 140 octets.  Other character sets (such as UCS-2 16-bit
   characters, resulting in 70-character messages) MAY also be supported
   [SMS-CHAR], but are defined as being optional by the SMS
   specification.  Consequently, applications handling SMS messages as
   part of a chain of character-processing applications MUST make sure
   that character sets are correctly mapped to and from the character
   set used for SMS messages.

   While the 160-character content type for SMS messages is by far the
   one most widely used, there are numerous other content types for SMS
   messages, such as small bitmaps (&quot;operator logos&quot;) and simple formats
   for musical notes (&quot;ring tones&quot;).  However, these formats are
   proprietary and are not considered in this memo.

   SMS messages are limited in length (140 octets), and the first
   versions of the SMS specification did not specify any standardized
   methods for concatenating SMS messages.  As a consequence, several
   proprietary methods were invented, but the current SMS specification
   does specify message concatenation.  In order to deal with this



Wilde &amp; Vaha-Sipila         Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 5724                    sms&quot; URI Scheme                 January 2010


   situation, SMS clients composing messages SHOULD use the standard
   concatenation method based on the header in the TP-User Data field as
   specified in the SMS specification [SMS].  When sending a message to
   an SMS recipient whose support for concatenated messages is unknown,
   the SMS client MAY opt to use the backwards-compatible (text-based)
   concatenation method defined in the SMS specification [SMS].
   Proprietary concatenation methods SHOULD NOT be used except in closed
   systems, where the capabilities of the recipient(s) are always known.

1.2.2.  SMS Infrastructure

   SMS messages can be transmitted over an SMS client&#39;s network
   interface using the signaling channels of the underlying GSTN
   infrastructure, so there is no delay for call setup.  Alternatively,
   SMS messages may be submitted through other front-ends (for example,
   Web-based services), which makes it possible for SMS clients to run
   on computers that are not directly connected to a GSTN network
   supporting SMS.

   SMS messages sent with the GSTN SMS service MUST be sent as class 1
   SMS messages, if the client is able to specify the message class.

1.2.2.1.  SMS Centers

   For delivery within GSTN networks, SMS messages are stored by an
   entity called SMS Center (SMSC) and sent to the recipient when the
   subscriber connects to the network.  The number of a cooperative SMSC
   must be known to the SMS sender (i.e., the entity submitting the SMS
   message to a GSTN infrastructure) when sending the message (usually
   the SMSC&#39;s number is configured in the SMS client and specific for
   the network operator to which the sender has subscribed).  In most
   situations, the SMSC number is part of the sending SMS client&#39;s
   configuration.  However, in some special cases (such as when the SMS
   recipient only accepts messages from a certain SMSC), it may be
   necessary to send the SMS message over a specific SMSC.  The scheme
   specified in this memo does not support the specification of SMSC
   numbers, so in case of scenarios where messages have to be sent
   through a certain SMSC, there must be some other context establishing
   this requirement or message delivery may fail.

1.2.3.  Uniform Resource Identifiers

   One of the core specifications for identifying resources on the
   Internet is [RFC3986], specifying the syntax and semantics of a
   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).  The most important notion of URIs
   are &quot;schemes&quot;, which define a framework within which resources can be
   uniquely identified and addressed.  URIs enable users to access
   resources and are used for very diverse schemes, such as access



Wilde &amp; Vaha-Sipila         Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 5724                    sms&quot; URI Scheme                 January 2010


   protocols (HTTP, FTP), broadcast media (TV channels [RFC2838]),
   messaging (email [RFC2368]), and even telephone numbers (voice
   [RFC3966]).

   URIs often are mentioned together with Uniform Resource Names (URNs)
   and/or Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and it often is unclear how
   to separate these concepts.  For the purpose of this memo, only the
   term URI will be used, referring to the most fundamental concept.
   The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has issued a note
   [uri-clarification] discussing the topic of URIs, URNs, and URLs in
   detail.

1.2.4.  SMS Messages and the Internet

   One of the important reasons for the universal access of the Web is
   the ability to access all information through a unique interface.
   This kind of integration makes it easy to provide information as well
   as to consume it.  One aspect of this integration is the support of
   user agents (in the case of the Web, commonly referred to as
   browsers) for multiple content formats (such as HTML, GIF, JPEG) and
   access schemes (such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP).

   The &quot;mailto&quot; scheme has proven to be very useful and popular because
   most user agents support it by providing an email composition
   facility when the user selects (e.g., clicks on) the URI.  Similarly,
   the &quot;sms&quot; scheme can be supported by user agents by providing an SMS
   message composition facility when the user selects the URI.  In cases
   where the user agent does not provide a built-in SMS message
   composition facility, the scheme could still be supported by opening
   a Web page that provides such a service.  The specific Web page to be
   used could be configured by the user, so that each user could use the
   SMS message composition service of his choice.

   The goal of this memo is to specify the &quot;sms&quot; URI scheme so that user
   agents (such as Web browsers and email clients) can start to support
   it.  The &quot;sms&quot; URI scheme identifies SMS message endpoints as
   resources.  When &quot;sms&quot; URIs are dereferenced, implementations MAY
   create a message and present it to be edited before being sent, or
   they MAY invoke additional services to provide the functionality
   necessary for composing a message and sending it to the SMS message
   endpoint.  In either case, simply activating a link with an &quot;sms&quot; URI
   SHOULD NOT cause a message to be sent without prior user
   confirmation.

RFC 5724                    sms&quot; URI Scheme                 January 2010


1.2.4.1.  SMS Messages and the Web

   SMS messages can provide an alternative to &quot;mailto&quot; URIs [RFC2368],
   or &quot;tel&quot; or &quot;fax&quot; URIs [RFC3966].  When an &quot;sms&quot; URI is activated,
   the user agent MAY start a program for sending an SMS message, just
   as &quot;mailto&quot; may open a mail client.  Unfortunately, most browsers do
   not support the external handling of internally unsupported URI
   schemes in the same generalized way as most of them support external
   handling of content for media types that they do not support
   internally.  Ideally, user agents should implement generic URI
   parsers and provide a way to associate unsupported schemes with
   external applications (or Web-based services).

   The recipient of an SMS message need not be a mobile phone.  It can
   be a server that can process SMS messages, either by gatewaying them
   to another messaging system (such as regular electronic mail), or by
   parsing them for supplementary services.

   SMS messages can be used to transport almost any kind of data (even
   though there is a very tight size limit), but the only standardized
   data formats are character-based messages in different character
   encodings.  SMS messages have a maximum length of 160 characters
   (when using 7-bit characters from the SMS character set), or 140
   octets.  However, SMS messages can be concatenated to form longer
   messages.  It is up to the user agent to decide whether to limit the
   length of the message, and how to indicate this limit in its user
   interface if necessary.  There is one exception to this; see
   Section 2.6.

1.2.4.2.  SMS Messages and Forms

   The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) [HTML401] provides a way to
   collect information from a user and pass it to a server for
   processing.  This functionality is known as &quot;HTML forms&quot;.  A
   filled-in form is usually sent to the destination using the Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or email.  However, SMS messages can also be
   used as the transport mechanism for these forms.  Depending on the
   network configuration, the sender&#39;s telephone number may be included
   in the SMS message, thus providing a weak form of authentication.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The capitalized key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;,
   &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

RFC 5724                    sms&quot; URI Scheme                 January 2010


2.  The &quot;sms&quot; URI Scheme

   Syntax definitions are given using the Augmented BNF (ABNF) for
   syntax specifications [RFC5234].

2.1.  Applicability

   This URI scheme provides information that can be used for sending SMS
   message(s) to specified recipient(s).  The functionality is
   comparable to that of the &quot;mailto&quot; URI, which (as per [RFC2368]) can
   also be used with a comma-separated list of email addresses.

   The notation for phone numbers is taken from [RFC3966] and its
   Erratum 203 [Err203].  Appendix A provides a corrected syntax of the
   telephone number.  Refer to that document for information on why this
   particular format was chosen.

   How SMS messages are sent to the SMSC or other intermediaries is
   outside the scope of this specification.  SMS messages can be sent
   over the GSM air interface by using a modem and a suitable protocol
   or by accessing services over other protocols, such as a Web-based
   service for sending SMS messages.  Also, SMS message service options
   like deferred delivery and delivery notification requests are not
   within the scope of this document.  Such services MAY be requested
   from the network by the user agent if necessary.

   SMS messages sent as a result of this URI MUST be sent as class 1 SMS
   messages, if the user agent is able to specify the message class.

2.2.  Formal Definition

RFC 5724                    sms&quot; URI Scheme                 January 2010


   Some illustrative examples using this syntax are given in
   Section 2.5.

   The syntax definition for &lt;telephone-subscriber&gt; is taken from
   Section 5.1 of [RFC3966].  Please consider Erratum 203 [Err203] in
   that specification.  For the reader&#39;s convenience, Appendix A
   contains a fixed syntax of the telephone number URI scheme, including
   Erratum 203, but RFC 3966 (plus all applicable errata) is the
   normative reference.  The description of phone numbers in RFC 3966
   (Section 5.1) states: &quot;The &#39;telephone-subscriber&#39; part of the URI
   indicates the number.  The phone number can be represented in either
   global (E.164) or local notation.  All phone numbers MUST use the
   global form unless they cannot be represented as such.  Numbers from
   private numbering plans, emergency (&quot;911&quot;, &quot;112&quot;), and some
   directory-assistance numbers (e.g., &quot;411&quot;) and other &quot;service codes&quot;
   (numbers of the form N11 in the United States) cannot be represented
   in global (E.164) form and need to be represented as a local number
   with a context.  Local numbers MUST be tagged with a &#39;phone-
   context&#39;.&quot;

   This specification defines a single &lt;sms-field&gt;: &quot;body&quot;.  Extensions
   to this specification MAY define additional fields.  Extensions MUST
   NOT change the semantics of the specifications they are extending.
   Unknown fields encountered in &quot;sms&quot; URIs MUST be ignored by
   implementations.

   The &quot;body&quot; &lt;sms-field&gt; is used to define the body of the SMS message
   to be composed.  It MUST not appear more than once in an &quot;sms&quot; URI.
   It consists of percent-encoded UTF-8 characters.  Implementations
   MUST make sure that the &quot;body&quot; &lt;sms-field&gt; characters are converted
   to a suitable character encoding before sending, the most popular
   being the 7-bit SMS character encoding, another variant (though not
   as universally supported as 7-bit SMS) is the UCS-2 character
   encoding (both specified in [SMS-CHAR]).  Implementations MAY choose
   to discard (or convert) characters in the &lt;sms-body&gt; that are not
   supported by the SMS character set they are using to send the SMS
   message.  If they do discard or convert characters, they MUST notify
   the user.

   The syntax definition for &lt;escaped-value&gt; refers to the text of an
   SMS where all &lt;reserved&gt; (as per [RFC3986]) characters in the SMS
   text are percent-encoded, please refer to [RFC3986] for the
   definitions of &lt;unreserved&gt; and &lt;pct-encoded&gt; and for details about
   percent-encoding.

   User agents SHOULD support multiple recipients and SHOULD make it
   clear to users what the entire list of recipients is before
   committing the user to sending all the messages.

2.3.  Processing an &quot;sms&quot; URI

   The following list describes the steps for processing an &quot;sms&quot; URI:

   1.  The phone number of the first &lt;sms-recipient&gt; is extracted.  It
       is the phone number of the final recipient and it MUST be written
       in international form with country code, unless the number only
       works from inside a certain geographical area or a network.  Note
       that some numbers may work from several networks but not from the
       whole world -- these SHOULD be written in international form.
       According to [RFC3966], all international numbers MUST begin with
       a &quot;+&quot; character.  Hyphens, dots, and parentheses (referred to as
       &quot;visual separators&quot; in RFC 3966) are used only to improve
       readability and MUST NOT convey any other meaning.

   2.  The &quot;body&quot; &lt;sms-field&gt; is extracted, if present.

   3.  The user agent SHOULD provide some means for message composition,
       either by implementing this itself or by accessing a service that
       provides it.  Message composition SHOULD start with the body
       extracted from the &quot;body&quot; &lt;sms-field&gt;, if present.

   4.  After message composition, a user agent SHOULD try to send the
       message first using the default delivery method employed by that
       user agent.  If that fails, the user agent MAY try another
       delivery method.

   5.  If the URI contains a comma-separated list of recipients (i.e.,
       it contains multiple &lt;sms-recipient&gt; parts), all of them are
       processed in this manner.  Exactly the same message SHOULD be
       sent to all of the listed recipients, which means that the
       message resulting from the message composition step for the first
       recipient is used unaltered for all other recipients as well.

   Two &quot;sms&quot; URIs are equivalent according to the following rules.
   Since the definition of the &lt;telephone-subscriber&gt; is taken from
   [RFC3966], equivalence of individual values of &lt;telephone-subscriber&gt;
   is based on the rules defined in Section 4 of [RFC3966], repeated
   here for convenience:

   o  Both must be either a &lt;local-number&gt; or a &lt;global-number&lt;, i.e.,
      start with a &quot;+&quot;.

   o  The &lt;global-number-digits&gt; and the &lt;local-number-digits&gt; must be
      equal, after removing all visual separators.

RFC 5724                    sms&quot; URI Scheme                 January 2010


   o  For mandatory additional parameters and the &lt;phone-context&gt; and
      &lt;extension&gt; parameters defined in [RFC3966], the &lt;phone-context&gt;
      parameter value is compared either as a host name if it is a
      &lt;domainname&gt; or digit-by-digit if it is &lt;global-number-digits&gt;.
      The latter is compared after removing all &lt;visual-separator&gt;
      characters.

   o  Parameters are compared according to &lt;pname&gt;, regardless of the
      order they appeared in the URI.  If one URI has a parameter name
      not found in the other, the two URIs are not equal.

   o  URI comparisons are case-insensitive.

   Since &quot;sms&quot; URIs can contain multiple &lt;telephone-subscriber&gt;s as well
   as &lt;sms-fields&gt;, in addition to adopting the rules defined for
   comparing &lt;telephone-subscriber&gt;s as defined by [RFC3966], two &quot;sms&quot;
   URIs are only equivalent if their &lt;sms-fields&gt; are identical, and if
   all &lt;telephone-subscriber&gt;s, compared pairwise as a set (i.e.,
   without taking sequence into consideration), are equivalent.

2.5.  Examples of Use

   sms:+15105550101

   This indicates an SMS-message-capable recipient at the given
   telephone number.  The message is sent using the user agent&#39;s default
   SMS delivery method.

   sms:+15105550101,+15105550102

   This indicates SMS-message-capable recipients at the given telephone
   numbers.  The identical message should be sent to both recipients
   using the user agent&#39;s default SMS delivery method.

   sms:+15105550101?body=hello%20there

   In this case, a message (initially being set to &quot;hello there&quot;, which
   may be modified by the user before sending) will be sent via SMS
   using the user agent&#39;s default SMS delivery method.

2.6.  Using &quot;sms&quot; URIs in HTML Forms

   When using an &quot;sms&quot; type URI as an action URI for HTML form
   submission [HTML401], the form contents MUST be packaged in the SMS
   message just as they are packaged when using a &quot;mailto&quot; URI
   [RFC2368], using the &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot; media type
   (as defined by HTML [HTML401]), effectively packaging all form data
   into URI-compliant syntax [RFC3986].  The SMS message MUST NOT



Wilde &amp; Vaha-Sipila         Standards Track                    [Page 10]

RFC 5724                    sms&quot; URI Scheme                 January 2010


   contain any HTTP header fields, only the form data.  The media type
   is implicit.  It MUST NOT be transferred in the SMS message.  Since
   the SMS message contains the form field values, the body &lt;sms-field&gt;
   of an &quot;sms&quot; type URI used for an HTML form will be ignored.

   The character encoding used for form submissions MUST be UTF-8
   [RFC3629].  It should be noted, however, that user agents MUST
   percent-encode form submissions before sending them (this encoding is
   specified by the URI syntax [RFC3986]).

   The user agent SHOULD inform the user about the possible security
   hazards involved when submitting the form (it is probably being sent
   as plain text over an air interface).

   If the form submission is longer than the maximum SMS message size,
   the user agent MAY either concatenate SMS messages, if it is able to
   do so, or it MAY refuse to send the message.  The user agent MUST NOT
   send out partial form submissions.

3.  URI Scheme Registration

   This memo requests the registration of the Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) scheme &quot;sms&quot; for specifying one or more recipients
   for an SMS message.  The registration request complies with
   [RFC4395].

3.1.  URI Scheme Name

   sms

3.2.  Status

   Permanent

3.3.  URI Scheme Syntax

   See Section 2.

3.4.  URI Scheme Semantics

   The &quot;sms&quot; URI scheme defines a way for a message to be composed and
   then transmitted using the SMS message transmission method.  This
   scheme can thus be compared to be &quot;mailto&quot; URI scheme [RFC2368].  See
   Section 2.3 for the details of operation.

RFC 5724                    sms&quot; URI Scheme                 January 2010


3.5.  Encoding Considerations

   The optional body field of &quot;sms&quot; URIs may contain a message text, but
   this text uses percent-encoded UTF-8 characters and thus can always
   be represented using URI characters.  See Section 2 for the details
   of encoding.

3.6.  Applications/Protocols That Use This URI Scheme Name

   The &quot;sms&quot; URI scheme is intended to be used in a similar way as the
   &quot;mailto&quot; URI scheme [RFC2368].  By using &quot;sms&quot; URIs, authors can
   embed information into documents that can be used as a starting point
   for initiating message composition.  Whether the client is sending
   the message itself (for example, over a GSM air interface) or
   redirecting the user to a third party for message composition (such
   as a Web service for sending SMS messages) is outside of the scope of
   the URI scheme definition.

3.7.  Interoperability Considerations

   No interoperability issues have been identified.

3.8.  Security Considerations

   See Section 4.

4.  Security Considerations

   SMS messages are transported without any provisions for privacy or
   integrity, so SMS users should be aware of these inherent security
   problems of SMS messages.  Unlike electronic mail, where additional
   mechanisms exist to layer security features on top of the basic
   infrastructure, there currently is no such framework for SMS
   messages.

   SMS messages very often are delivered almost instantaneously (if the
   receiving SMS client is online), but there is no guarantee for when
   SMS messages will be delivered.  In particular, SMS messages between



Wilde &amp; Vaha-Sipila         Standards Track                    [Page 12]

RFC 5724                    sms&quot; URI Scheme                 January 2010


   different network operators sometimes take a long time to be
   delivered (hours or even days) or are not delivered at all, so
   applications SHOULD NOT make any assumptions about the reliability
   and performance of SMS message transmission.

   In most networks, sending SMS messages is not a free service.
   Therefore, SMS clients MUST make sure that any action that incurs
   costs is acknowledged by the end user, unless explicitly instructed
   otherwise by the end user.  If an SMS client has different ways of
   submitting an SMS message (such as a Web service and a phone line),
   then the end user MUST have a way to control which way is chosen.

   SMS clients often are limited devices (typically mobile phones), and
   the sending SMS client SHOULD NOT make any assumptions about the
   receiving SMS client supporting any non-standard services, such as
   proprietary message concatenation or proprietary content types.
   However, if the sending SMS client has prior knowledge about the
   receiving SMS client, then he MAY use this knowledge to compose non-
   standard SMS messages.

   There are certain special SMS messages defined in the SMS
   specification [SMS] that can be used, for example, to turn on
   indicators on the phone display or to send data to certain
   communication ports (comparable to UDP ports) on the device.  Certain
   proprietary systems (for example, the Wireless Application Protocol
   [WAP]) define configuration messages that may be used to reconfigure
   the devices remotely.  Any SMS client SHOULD make sure that malicious
   use of such messages is not possible, for example, by filtering out
   certain SMS User Data header fields.  Gateways that accept SMS
   messages (e.g., in email messages or Web forms) and pass them on to
   an SMSC SHOULD implement this kind of &quot;firewalling&quot; approach as well.

   Because of the narrow bandwidth of the SMS communications channel,
   there should also be checks in place for excessively long
   concatenated messages.  As an example, it may take two minutes to
   transfer thirty concatenated text messages.

   Unchecked input from a user MUST NOT be used to populate any other
   fields in an SMS message other than the User Data field (not
   including the User Data header field).  All other parts, including
   the User Data header, of the short message should only be generated
   by trusted means.

   By including &quot;sms&quot; URIs in unsolicited messages (a.k.a. &quot;spam&quot;) or
   other types of advertising, the originator of the &quot;sms&quot; URIs may
   attempt to reveal an individual&#39;s phone number and/or to link the
   identity (i.e., email address) used for messaging with the identity
   (i.e., phone number) used for the mobile phone.  This attempt to



Wilde &amp; Vaha-Sipila         Standards Track                    [Page 13]

RFC 5724                    sms&quot; URI Scheme                 January 2010


   collect information may be a privacy issue, and user agents may make
   users aware of that risk before composing or sending SMS messages.
   Users agents that do not provide any feedback about this privacy
   issue make users more vulnerable to this kind of attack.

   A user agent SHOULD NOT send out SMS messages without the knowledge
   of the user because of associated risks, which include sending masses
   of SMS messages to a subscriber without his consent, and the costs
   involved in sending an SMS message.

   As suggested functionality, the user agent MAY offer a possibility
   for the user to filter out those phone numbers that are expressed in
   local format, as most premium-rate numbers are expressed in local
   format, and because determining the correct local context (and hence
   the validity of the number to this specific user) may be very
   difficult.

   When using &quot;sms&quot; URIs as targets of forms (as described in
   Section 2.6), the user agent SHOULD inform the user about the
   possible security hazards involved when submitting the form (it is
   probably being sent as plain text over an air interface).

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has registered the &quot;sms&quot; URI scheme, using the template in
   Section 3, in accordance with [RFC4395].

Some countries, eg S.Korea, do not use/have GMS, but *CDMA* instead.

It should say:

&lt;n/a — RFC ¿rewrite?&gt;

Notes:

Current SMS availability…
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS: 
1985… Since then, support for the service has expanded to include other mobile technologies such as ANSI CDMA networks and Digital AMPS, as well as satellite and landline networks.
