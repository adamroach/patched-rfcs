1.  Introduction

   This memo defines an extension to the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it defines objects for the management of
   coffee-brewing and maintenance devices.

2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

      o    RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
           describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

RFC 2325                         CP MIB                     1 April 1998


      o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
           objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      o    RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other
           architectural aspects of the framework.

      o    RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network
           access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named
   by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
   refer to the object type.

3.  Overview

   The COFFEE POT MIB applies to managed devices that brew, store, and
   deliver heated coffee beverages. The COFFEE POT MIB is mandatory for
   all systems that have such a hardware port supporting services
   managed through some other MIB.

   The MIB contains objects that relate to physical connections,
   configuration, storage levels, availabilty, quality of service, and
   availability.

3.1.  Relationship to Interface MIB

   The COFFEE-POT-MIB is one of many MIBs designed for layered use as
   described in the Interface MIB [5].  In most implementations where it
   is present, it will be in the lowest interface sublayer, that is, the
   COFFEE-POT-MIB represents the physical layer, providing service to
   higher layers such as the Character MIB [6].

   Although it is unlikely that a coffee port will actually be used as a
   network interface, which is the intent of the Interface MIB, the
   COFFEE-POT-MIB is closely connected to the Character MIB, which can
   share hardware interfaces with network operation, and relate to the
   RS-232 MIB [7].

RFC 2325                         CP MIB                     1 April 1998


   The Interface MIB&#39;s ifTestTable and ifRcvAddressTable are not
   relevant to the COFFEE-POT-MIB.

   The COFFEE-POT-MIB is relevant for ifType values sip(31), and perhaps
   others.

   The COFFEE-POT-MIB requires the conformance groups ifGeneralGroup,
   and ifFixedLengthGroup.

   Usefulness of error counters in this MIB depends on the octet
   counters in ifFixedLengthGroup.
