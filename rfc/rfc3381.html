Abstract

   This document defines four new Job Description attributes for
   monitoring job progress to be registered as OPTIONAL extensions to
   the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP/1.0 and IPP/1.1).  These
   attributes are drawn from the PWG Job Monitoring MIB.  This document
   also defines a new &quot;sheet-collate&quot; Job Template attribute to control
   sheet collation and to help with the interpretation of the job
   progress attributes.

1 Introduction

   This document defines four new Job Description attributes for
   monitoring job progress to be registered as OPTIONAL extensions to
   IPP/1.0 [RFC2566] and IPP/1.1 [RFC2911].  These attributes are drawn
   from the PWG Job Monitoring MIB [RFC2707].  See section 10 for a
   description of the base IPP documents.  The new Job Description
   attributes are:

      &quot;job-collation-type&quot; (type2 enum)
      &quot;sheet-completed-copy-number&quot; (integer(0:MAX))
      &quot;sheet-completed-document-number&quot; (integer(0:MAX))
      &quot;impressions-completed-current-copy&quot; (integer(0:MAX))

   This document also defines a new &quot;sheet-collate&quot; Job Template
   attribute to control sheet collation and to help with the
   interpretation of the job progress attributes.  These new attributes
   may also be used by themselves in combination with the IPP/1.1 &quot;job-
   impressions-completed&quot; attribute, as useful job progress monitoring
   attributes and/or may be passed in an IPP Notification (see [ipp-
   ntfy]).

2 Terminology

   This section defines terminology used throughout this document.

2.1 Conformance Terminology

   Capitalized terms, such as MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD
   NOT, MAY, NEED NOT, and OPTIONAL, have special meaning relating to
   conformance, as defined in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and [RFC2911] section
   12.1.  If an implementation supports the extension defined in this
   document, then these terms apply; otherwise, they do not.  These
   terms define conformance to this document only; they do not affect
   conformance to other documents, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

2.2 Other terminology

   This document uses terms such as Job object (or Job), IPP Printer
   object (or Printer), &quot;operation&quot;, &quot;attribute&quot;, &quot;keyword&quot;, &quot;support&quot;,
   and &quot;impression&quot;.  These terms have special meaning and are defined
   in the model terminology [RFC2911], section 12.2.

3 Job Template attributes

3.1 sheet-collate (type2 keyword)

   +===================+======================+=====================+
   | Job Attribute     |Printer: Default Value|  Printer: Supported |
   |                   |   Attribute          |   Values Attribute  |
   +===================+======================+=====================+
   | sheet-collate     | sheet-collate-default| sheet-collate-      |
   | (type2 keyword)   | (type2 keyword)      |  supported (1setOf  |
   |                   |                      |      type2 keyword) |
   +-------------------+----------------------+---------------------+

   This attribute specifies whether or not the media sheets of each copy
   of each printed document in a job are to be in sequence, when
   multiple copies of the document are specified by the &#39;copies&#39;
   attribute.

   Standard keyword values are:

      &#39;uncollated&#39;:  each print-stream sheet is printed a number of
         times in succession equal to the value of the &#39;copies&#39;
         attribute, followed by the next print-stream sheet.

      &#39;collated&#39;:  each copy of each document is printed with the
         print-stream sheets in sequence, followed by the next document
         copy.



Hastings, et. al.           Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 3381              IPP: Job Progress Attributes        September 2002


   For example, suppose a document produces two media sheets as output,
   and &quot;copies&quot; is equal to &#39;6&#39;.  For the &#39;uncollated&#39; case, six copies
   of the first media sheet are printed, followed by six copies of the
   second media sheet.  For the &#39;collated&#39; case, one copy of each of the
   six sheets is printed, followed by another copy of each of the six
   media sheets.

   Whether the effect of sheet collation is achieved by placing copies
   of a document in multiple output bins, or in the same output bin with
   implementation defined document separation, is implementation
   dependent.  Also whether it is achieved by making multiple passes
   over the job or by using an output sorter, is implementation
   dependent.

   Note: IPP/1.0 [RFC2566] and IPP/1.1 [RFC2911] are silent on whether
   or not sheets within documents are collated.  The &quot;sheet-collate-
   supported&quot; Printer attribute permits a Printer object to indicate
   whether or not it collates sheets with each document and whether it
   allows the client to control sheet collation.  An implementation is
   able to indicate that it supports uncollated sheets, collated sheets,
   or both, using the &#39;uncollated&#39;, &#39;collated&#39;, or both &#39;uncollated&#39; and
   &#39;collated&#39; values, respectively.

   This attribute is affected by &quot;multiple-document-handling&quot;.  The
   &quot;multiple-document-handling&quot; attribute describes the collation of
   documents, and the &quot;sheet-collate&quot; attribute describes the semantics
   of collating individual pages within a document.  To better explain
   the interaction between these two attributes, the term &quot;set&quot; is
   introduced.  A &quot;set&quot; is a logical boundary between the delivered
   media sheets of a printed job.  For example, in the case of a ten
   page single document with collated pages and a request for 50 copies,
   each of the 50 printed copies of the document constitutes a &quot;set&quot;.
   In the above example if the pages were uncollated, then 50 copies of
   each of the individual pages within the document would represent each
   &quot;set&quot;.

   The following table describes the interaction of &quot;sheet-collate&quot; with
   multiple document handling.

                     document&#39;        documents, with their pages in
                                      sequence, represents a &quot;set&quot;.

                                      to the &quot;copies&quot; attribute; which
                                      constitutes a &quot;set&quot;.

      &#39;uncollated&#39;   &#39;single-         Each media sheet of the
                     document-new-    concatenated documents is printed

                                      &quot;copies&quot; attribute; which
                                      constitutes a &quot;set&quot;.

      From the above table it is obvious that the implicit value of the
      &quot;sheet-collate&quot; attribute in a printer that does not support the
      &quot;sheet-collate&quot; attribute, is &#39;collated.&#39;  The semantics of
      &quot;multiple-document-handling&quot; are otherwise nonsensical in the case
      of separate documents.

4 IPP Job Description attributes for monitoring Job Progress

   The following IPP Job Description attributes are proposed to be added
   to IPP through the type2 registration procedures.  They are useful
   for monitoring the progress of a job.  They are also used as
   attributes in the notification content in a notification report
   [ipp-ntfy].

   There are a number of Job Description attributes for monitoring the
   progress of a job.  These objects and attributes count the number of
   K octets, impressions, sheets, and pages requested or completed.  For
   impressions and sheets, &quot;completed&quot; means stacked, unless the
   implementation is unable to detect when each sheet is stacked, in
   which case, stacked is approximated when the processing of each sheet
   is completed.  There are objects and attributes for the overall job
   and for the current copy of the document currently being stacked.
   For the latter, the rate at which the various objects and attributes
   count, depends on the sheet and document collation of the job.

   Consider the following four Job Description attributes that are used
   to monitor the progress of a job&#39;s impressions:

      1. &quot;job-impressions-completed&quot; - counts the total number of
         impressions stacked for the job (see [RFC2911] section
         4.3.18.2).

      2. &quot;impressions-completed-current-copy&quot; - counts the number of
         impressions stacked for the current document copy.

      3. &quot;sheet-completed-copy-number&quot; - identifies the number of the
         copy for the current document being stacked, where the first
         copy is 1.

      4. &quot;sheet-completed-document-number&quot; - identifies the current
         document within the job that is being stacked, where the first
         document in a job is 1.  NOTE: this attribute SHOULD NOT be
         implemented for implementations that only support one document
         per job.

   For each of the three types of job collation, a job with three copies
   of two documents (1, 2), where each document consists of 3
   impressions, the four variables have the following values, as each
   sheet is stacked for one-sided printing:

   &quot;job-collation-type&quot; = &#39;uncollated-sheets(3)&#39;

                    produce collated sheets as far as the user is
                    concerned (in the output bins).  However, when the
                    job collation is the &#39;uncollated-sheets(3)&#39; value,
                    job progress is indistinguishable from a monitoring
                    application between a device that has an output bin
                    collator and one that does not.

      &#39;4&#39; &#39;collated-documents&#39;:  Collation of the sheets within each
                    document copy is performed within the printing
                    device by making multiple passes over, either the
                    source or an intermediate representation of the
                    document.  In addition, when there are multiple
                    documents per job, the i&#39;th copy of each document is
                    stacked before the j&#39;th copy of each document, i.e.,
                    the documents are collated within each job copy.
                    For example, if a job is submitted with documents, A
                    and B, the job is made available to the end user as:
                    A, B, A, B, ....  The &#39;collated-documents(4)&#39; value
                    corresponds to the IPP [RFC2911] &#39;separate-
                    documents-collated-copies&#39; keyword value of the
                    &quot;multiple-document-handling&quot; attribute.

                    If the job&#39;s &quot;copies&quot; attribute is &#39;1&#39; (or not
                    supplied), then the &quot;job-collation-type&quot; attribute
                    is defined to be &#39;4&#39;.

      &#39;5&#39; &#39;uncollated-documents&#39;:  Collation of the sheets within each
                    document copy is performed within the printing
                    device by making multiple passes over either the
                    source or an intermediate representation of the
                    document.  In addition, when there are multiple
                    documents per job, all copies of the first document
                    in the job are stacked before any copied of the next
                    document in the job, i.e., the documents are
                    uncollated within the job.  For example, if a job is
                    submitted with documents, A and B, the job is made
                    available to the end user as:  A, A, ..., B, B, ....
                    The &#39;uncollated-documents(5)&#39; value corresponds to
                    the IPP [RFC2911] &#39;separate-documents-uncollated-
                    copies&#39; keyword value of the &quot;multiple-document-
                    handling&quot; attribute.

4.2 sheet-completed-copy-number (integer(0:MAX))

   The number of the copy being stacked for the current document.  This
   number starts at 0, is set to 1 when the first sheet of the first
   copy for each document is being stacked and is equal to n where n is
   the nth sheet stacked in the current document copy.  If the value is
   unknown, the Printer MUST return the &#39;unknown&#39; out-of-band value (see
   [RFC2911] section 4.1), rather than the -2 value used in some MIBs
   [RFC2707].

4.3 sheet-completed-document-number (integer(0:MAX))

   The ordinal number of the document in the job that is currently being
   stacked.  This number starts at 0, increments to 1 when the first
   sheet of the first document in the job is being stacked, and is equal
   to n where n is the nth document in the job, starting with 1. If the
   value is unknown, the Printer MUST return the &#39;unknown&#39; out-of-band
   value (see [RFC2911] section 4.1), rather than the -2 value used in
   some MIBs [RFC2707].

   Implementations that only support one document job SHOULD NOT
   implement this attribute.

4.4 impressions-completed-current-copy (integer(0:MAX))

   The number of impressions completed by the device for the current
   copy of the current document so far.  For printing, the impressions
   completed includes interpreting, marking, and stacking the output.
   For other types of job services, the number of impressions completed
   includes the number of impressions processed.  If the value is
   unknown, the Printer MUST return the &#39;unknown&#39; out-of-band value (see
   [RFC2911] section 4.1), rather than the -2 value used in some MIBs
   [RFC2707].

   This value MUST be reset to 0 for each document in the job and for
   each document copy.

5 Conformance Requirements

   This section summarizes the Conformance Requirements detailed in the
   definitions in this document.  In general each of the attributes
   defined in this document are OPTIONAL for a client and/or a Printer
   to support, so that client and Printer implementers MAY implement any
   combination of these attributes.

10 Description of the Base IPP Documents

   The base set of IPP documents includes:

      Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol [RFC2567]
      Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the
      Internet Printing Protocol [RFC2568]
      Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics [RFC2911]
      Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport [RFC2910]
      Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer&#39;s Guide [RFC3196]
      Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols [RFC2569]

   The &quot;Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol&quot; document takes a
   broad look at distributed printing functionality, and enumerates
   real-life scenarios that help to clarify the features that need to be
   included in a printing protocol for the Internet.  It identifies
   requirements for three types of users: end users, operators, and
   administrators.  It calls out a subset of end user requirements that
   are satisfied in IPP/1.0 [RFC2566, RFC2565].  A few OPTIONAL operator
   operations have been added to IPP/1.1 [RFC2911, RFC2910].

   The &quot;Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the
   Internet Printing Protocol&quot; document describes IPP from a high level
   view, defines a roadmap for the various documents that form the suite
   of IPP specification documents, and gives background and rationale
   for the IETF IPP working group&#39;s major decisions.

   The &quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot; document
   describes a simplified model with abstract objects, their attributes,
   and their operations.  The model introduces a Printer and a Job.  The
   Job supports multiple documents per Job.  The model document also
   addresses how security, internationalization, and directory issues
   are addressed.

   The &quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport&quot; document
   is a formal mapping of the abstract operations and attributes defined
   in the model document onto HTTP/1.1 [RFC2616].  It also defines the
   encoding rules for a new Internet MIME media type called
   &quot;application/ipp&quot;.  This document also defines the rules for
   transporting over HTTP a message body whose Content-Type is

RFC 3381              IPP: Job Progress Attributes        September 2002


   &quot;application/ipp&quot;.  This document defines the &#39;ipp&#39; scheme for
   identifying IPP printers and jobs.

   The &quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer&#39;s Guide&quot; document
   gives insight and advice to implementers of IPP clients and IPP
   objects.  It is intended to help them understand IPP/1.1 and some of
   the considerations that may assist them in the design of their client
   and/or IPP object implementations.  For example, a typical order of
   processing requests is given, including error checking.  Motivation
   for some of the specification decisions is also included.

   The &quot;Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols&quot; document gives some
   advice to implementers of gateways between IPP and LPD (Line Printer
   Daemon) implementations.

   In addition to the base IPP documents, the &quot;Event Notification
   Specification&quot; document [ipp-ntfy] defines OPTIONAL operations that
   allow a client to subscribe to printing related events.
   Subscriptions include &quot;Per-Job subscriptions&quot; and &quot;Per-Printer
   subscriptions&quot;.  Subscriptions are modeled as Subscription objects.
   Four other operations are defined for subscription objects:  get
   attributes, get subscriptions, renew a subscription, and cancel a
   subscription.
