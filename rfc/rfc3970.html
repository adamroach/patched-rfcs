RFC 3970             A Traffic Engineering (TE) MIB         January 2005


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for Traffic Engineered
   (TE) Tunnels; for example, Multi-Protocol Label Switched Paths ([7],
   [8]).  The MIB module defined by this memo allows one to configure TE
   Tunnels, to assign one or more paths to a Tunnel, and to monitor
   operational aspects of the Tunnel, such as the number of octets and
   packets that have passed through the Tunnel.

   As it stands, this MIB module can only be used to configure or
   monitor a TE Tunnel at its ingress.  The ingress is then expected to
   use some protocol (such as RSVP-TE) to signal the other routers in
   the path the information they need to set up the tunnel.  The
   extension of this module for use at other points of a Tunnel is for
   further study.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [8].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [2], STD 58, RFC 2579 [3] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [4].

3.  Overview of the MIB Module

   The Traffic Engineering MIB module consists of four parts:

      1) Traffic Engineering information,
      2) a table of Traffic Engineering Tunnels,
      3) a table of Paths that tunnels take, and
      4) a table of Hops that make up a tunnel path.

   The MIB module also has statements for minimal and full compliance.

RFC 3970             A Traffic Engineering (TE) MIB         January 2005


   The following subsections give an overview of each part.  All objects
   are mandatory.  For minimal compliance, all objects MAY be
   implemented read-only; for full compliance, all objects must be
   implemented to their stated MAX-ACCESS capabilities.  Notifications
   are optional.

3.1.  Traffic Engineering Information

   This part contains information about the Link State Protocols used to
   carry TE information, the signaling protocols used to set up Traffic
   Tunnels, the number of Traffic Tunnels that have been configured and
   that are operational, and a mapping of Administrative Group (called
   Resource Classes in [7]) numbers to names.

3.2.  Traffic Tunnel Information

   This part contains a table of Traffic Tunnels and information about
   each one.  This information includes the Tunnel name, its
   configuration information, its operational information, and the
   active path(s) that the Tunnel takes.

   Configuration information includes the end points of the Traffic
   Tunnel, and the number of configured paths for the Traffic Tunnel.

   Operational information includes the current state (up/down), the
   count of octets and packets sent on the Traffic Tunnel, how long it
   has been up, and how many state transitions the Traffic Tunnel has
   had.

   Operational path information includes the number of operational
   paths, the number of path changes, and when the last path change was.

3.3.  Path Information

   A Tunnel is a logical entity.  An instantiation of a Tunnel is one or
   more Paths; each Path has a route (also called Explicit Route) or
   sequence of hops.  A Path is indexed by a dual index: The primary
   index is that of the Tunnel to which the Path belongs; the secondary
   index is that of the Path itself.

   The configured information for a Path consists of the constraints for
   the Path and a configured route.

   The operational information consists of the Path status, the computed
   route (i.e., the route that was computed to satisfy the constraints),
   and the actual path as recorded by the signaling protocol.

RFC 3970             A Traffic Engineering (TE) MIB         January 2005


3.4.  Hop Information

   A path consists of a sequence of hops.  A hop can be loose (meaning
   that the path eventually traverses the specified node) or strict
   (meaning that the specified node and possibly the link must be the
   next node in the path).  A hop can be specified as an IPv4 address,
   an IPv6 address, an Autonomous System number or an unnumbered
   interface index [5].

   The Hop Table contains all hops for all paths on a given router.  It
   is organized as follows.  There is a primary index that identifies a
   list of hops and a secondary index that identifies individual hops.
   Thus, to get the sequence of recorded hops for a path, one looks up
   the path&#39;s tePathRecordedRoute, which is a primary index into the Hop
   Table.  Then to get the list of actual hops in order for the recorded
   path, one uses a secondary index of 1, 2, ....

3.5.  Relationship with Other MIB Modules

   A TE Tunnel can extend objects from two other MIB modules; one is the
   Interfaces MIB [10], and the other is the IP Tunnel MIB [11].  The
   mechanism for doing so is to assign the TE Tunnel index
   (teTunnelIndex) with a valid ifIndex value in ifTable.

   If a TE Tunnel is deemed an interface, a new interface object is
   created and assigned an ifIndex value in ifTable.  Then a TE Tunnel
   object is created, setting teTunnelIndex to the same value as the
   interface index.

   If (and only if) a TE Tunnel is considered an interface, it may also
   be considered an IP tunnel (if the encapsulation of the TE Tunnel is
   IP).  In that case, the interface associated with the TE Tunnel
   should have its ifType set to tunnel(131).

   If a TE Tunnel is not considered an interface, then the TE Tunnel
   index (teTunnelIndex) SHOULD be set to a value at least 2^24, so that
   it is distinct from normal interfaces.

4.  Creating, Modifying, and Deleting a TE Tunnel

   To create a TE Tunnel, one first obtains a free Tunnel index by using
   the object teNextTunnelIndex.  One then creates the Tunnel, including
   all parameters, either as createAndGo or createAndWait.  Then, TE
   Paths for this Tunnel can be created by using the
   teTunnelNextPathIndex object, again as createAndGo or createAndWait.
   A particular Path is computed and signaled when both the Path and the
   enclosing Tunnel have RowStatus &#39;active&#39;.




Kompella                    Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 3970             A Traffic Engineering (TE) MIB         January 2005


   To build a Path&#39;s configured route, one first gets a free PathHop
   index by using teNextPathHopIndex, and then builds the route hop-by-
   hop using the secondary index, setting the AddrType, Address, and
   HopType for each Hop.  Finally, one sets the tePathConfiguredRoute in
   the Path to the PathHop index obtained.

   Modifying certain properties of a TE Tunnel or a TE Path may require
   setting the RowStatus of the Tunnel (or Path) to &#39;notInService&#39;
   before making the changes and then setting the RowStatus of the
   Tunnel (or Path) back to &#39;active&#39; to re-signal all Paths of the
   Tunnel (or the modified Path).

   A TE Tunnel and all its Paths can be deleted by setting the Tunnel&#39;s
   RowStatus to &#39;destroy&#39;.  A specific Path within a Tunnel can be
   destroyed by setting that Path&#39;s RowStatus to &#39;destroy&#39;.

5.  MIB Specification

                    The special value of 0 indicates that no more new

                    When this MIB module is used for configuration, this
                    object always contains a legal value (if non-zero)
                    for an index that is not currently used in that
                    table.  The Command Generator (Network Management
                    Application) reads this variable and uses the
                    (non-zero) value read when creating a new row with
                    an SNMP SET.  When the SET is performed, the Command
                    Responder (agent) must determine whether the value
                    is indeed still unused; Two Network Management

                    (configuration entry) simultaneously and use the
                    same value.  If it is currently unused, the SET
                    succeeds, and the Command Responder (agent) changes
                    the value of this object according to an
                    implementation-specific algorithm.  If the value is
                    in use, however, the SET fails.  The Network
                    Management Application must then re-read this
                    variable to obtain a new usable value.

                    entry represents an Administrative Group and
                    provides a name and index for the group.
                    Administrative groups are used to label links in the
                    Traffic Engineering topology in order to place
                    constraints (include and exclude) on Tunnel paths.

                    A groupName can only be linked to one group number.
                    The groupNumber is the number assigned to the
                    administrative group used in constraints,
                    such as tePathIncludeAny or tePathIncludeAll.

                    When this MIB module is used for configuration, this
                    object always contains a legal value (if non-zero)
                    for an index that is not currently used in that
                    table.  The Command Generator (Network Management
                    Application) reads this variable and uses the
                    (non-zero) value read when creating a new row with
                    an SNMP SET.  When the SET is performed, the Command
                    Responder (agent) must determine whether the value
                    is indeed still unused; Two Network Management
                    Applications may attempt to create a row
                    (configuration entry) simultaneously and use the
                    same value.  If it is currently unused, the SET
                    succeeds, and the Command Responder (agent) changes
                    the value of this object according to an
                    implementation-specific algorithm.  If the value is
                    in use, however, the SET fails.  The Network
                    Management Application must then re-read this
                    variable to obtain a new usable value.

7.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module relates to the configuration and management of
   Traffic Engineering tunnels.  The unauthorized manipulation of fields
   in the tables teAdminGroupTable, teTunnelTable, tePathTable, and
   tePathHopTable may lead to tunnel flapping, tunnel paths being
   changed, or traffic being disrupted.  In addition, if these tables
   are read by unauthorized parties, the information can be used to
   trace traffic patterns, traffic volumes, and tunnel paths.  This may
   be considered proprietary and confidential information by some
   providers.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   teAdminGroupTable: Changing this will affect the semantics of include
   and exclude constraints, and thus traffic takes unintended routes.

   teTunnelTable: Changing this affects many properties of traffic
   tunnels.

   tePathTable: Changing this affects the constraints (including
   bandwidth) of tunnel paths, as well as the status of the path.

   tePathHopTable: Changing this affects the route followed by a traffic
   tunnel path.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      teTunnelTable:  Describes tunnel endpoints and traffic volumes.
      tePathTable:    Describes path properties.
      tePathHopTable: Describes path routes.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [9], section 8), including full
   support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication
   and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

Acknowledgments

   It was Tony Li&#39;s suggestion that the author embark on this MIB.  Many
   thanks to him and to Der-Hwa Gan for their input and help.

   Many thanks, too, to Bert Wijnen for his incredible help, both with
   improving the correctness, structure, and readability of the MIB
   module, and with the text of the RFC.  Thanks also to Adrian Farrel
   for his detailed review.

Notes:

The DESCRIPTION clauses of
    -  teTunnelOctects and teTunnelLPOctects
    -  teTunnelPackets and teTunnelLPPackets
are pairwise identical, respectively.

There is no precise description of the precise meaning of
these  &quot;teTunnelLPxxx&quot;  objects.
Admittedly, one might guess from the SYNTAX clauses of these
objects that &quot;LP&quot; stands for 'lower part' -- meaning that the
value of a &quot;teTunnelLPOctets&quot; object should always equal the
value of the corresponding &quot;teTunnelOctets&quot; object MODULO 2^32
(and similarly for the &quot;...Packets&quot; objects), but this is not
stated in the text.

Furthermore, unfortunately the naming of these objects does
not conform to the conventional naming style used in (almost)
all IETF standards track MIB modules with High Capacity
counters, e. g.  &quot;xxxOctets&quot;  and  &quot;xxxHCOctets&quot; .
The above interpretation would be more manifest if this
standard naming convention would have been followed.

Now, given that the naming of the objects cannot be changed
any more, it would certainly be useful to have a textual
clarification of these DESCRIPTIONs posted on the RFC Editor's
RFC-Errata web page.
