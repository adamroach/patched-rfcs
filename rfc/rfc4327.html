1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Introduction

   Current work is under way in the IETF to specify a suite of protocols
   to be used as a common control plane and a separate common
   measurement plane.  Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) [RFC3471] and the Link
   Management Protocol [RFC4204] are key components of this
   standardization activity.  The primary purpose of LMP is to manage
   traffic engineering (TE) links.  Primary goals of LMP are the
   maintenance of the control channel connectivity, correlation of link
   properties, verification of data-bearing links, and detection and
   isolation of link faults.

   We describe in this document a MIB module that can be used to manage
   LMP implementations.  This MIB module covers both configuration and
   performance monitoring aspects of LMP.

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

RFC 4327                     LMP-MIB Module                 January 2006


3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the Link
   Management Protocol [RFC4204].  An &quot;LMP adjacency&quot; is formed between
   two nodes that support the same capabilities, and LMP messages are
   exchanged between the node pair over control channels that form this
   adjacency.  Several control channels can be active at the same time.
   With the exception of messages related to control channel management,
   anytime an LMP message needs to be transferred to a neighbor node, it
   can be sent on any of the active control channels.  The control
   channels can also be used to exchange MPLS control plane information
   or routing information.

   LMP is designed to support aggregation of one or more data-bearing
   links into a traffic-engineering (TE) link.  The data-bearing links
   can be either component links or ports depending on their
   multiplexing capability (see [RFC4204] for distinction between port
   and component link).

   Each TE link is associated with an LMP adjacency, and one or more
   control channels are used to exchange LMP messages for a particular
   adjacency.  In turn, control channels are used to manage the TE links
   associated with the LMP adjacency.

4.  Feature Checklist

   The Link Management Protocol MIB module (LMP-MIB) is designed to
   satisfy the following requirements and constraints:

   -  The MIB module supports the enabling and disabling of LMP
      capability on LMP-capable interfaces of a photonic switch, optical
      cross-connect, or router.

   -  The MIB module is used to provide information about LMP
      adjacencies.

   -  Support is provided for configuration of the keep alive and link
      verification parameters.

   -  The MIB module is used to express the mapping between local and
      remote TE links, as well as local and remote interface identifiers
      for port or component link.

   -  Performance counters are provided for measuring LMP performance on
      a per-control channel basis.  Performance counters are also
      provided for measuring LMP performance on the data-bearing links.

RFC 4327                     LMP-MIB Module                 January 2006


   Note that the LMP MIB module goes hand-in-hand with the TE Link
   (TE-LINK-STD-MIB) MIB module [RFC4220].  The TE link table, which is
   used to associate data-bearing links to TE links, is defined in the
   TE Link MIB.  The TE link table in the LMP MIB module contains TE
   link information specific to LMP.

5.  Outline

   Configuring LMP through an optical device involves the following
   steps:

   -  Enabling LMP on LMP-capable interfaces through control channel
      configuration.

   -  Optionally specifying link verification parameters.

   -  Configuring the data-bearing links and associating them to the
      appropriate TE link (this association is stored in the
      ifStackTable of the Interfaces Group MIB).

   TE links are managed by the control channels that run between the
   same pair of nodes (LMP adjacency).

6.  Brief Description of MIB Objects

   Sections 6.1-6.8 describe objects pertaining to LMP.  The MIB objects
   were derived from the LMP document [RFC4204].

6.1.  lmpNbrTable

   The remote node table is used to identify the pair of nodes that
   exchange LMP messages over control channels.

6.2.  lmpControlChannelTable

   The control channel table is used for enabling the LMP protocol on
   LMP-capable interfaces.  A photonic switch, optical cross-connect, or
   router creates an entry in this table for every LMP-capable interface
   in that device.

6.3.  lmpControlChannelPerfTable

   The control channel performance table is used for collecting LMP
   performance counts on a per-control channel basis.  Each entry in the
   lmpControlChannelTable has a corresponding entry in the
   lmpControlChannelPerfTable.

RFC 4327                     LMP-MIB Module                 January 2006


6.4.  lmpTeLinkTable

   The TE link table is used for specifying LMP information associated
   with TE links.

6.5.  lmpLinkVerificationTable

   The link verification table is used for configuring the LMP link
   verification parameters of TE links.  For every TE link entry in the
   lmpTeLinkTable that supports the link verification procedure, there
   is a corresponding entry in the lmpLinkVerificationTable.

6.6.  lmpTeLinkPerfTable

   The TE link performance table is used for collecting LMP performance
   counts on a per-TE link basis.  Each entry in the lmpTeLinkTable has
   a corresponding entry in the lmpTeLinkPerfTable.

6.7.  lmpDataLinkTable

   The data-bearing link table is used to specify the data-bearing links
   that are associated with TE links.

6.8.  lmpDataLinkPerfTable

   The data-bearing link performance table is used for collecting LMP
   performance counts on data-bearing links.

RFC 4327 makes use of the TruthValue textual convention defined in RFC
2579.

Several places in the text identify the enumerations of the textual
convention (&quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;) using their names and their numeric values
(1 and 2 respectively).

However, several references to the enumerations of the textual convention
use the incorrect numeric values.

All references to the enumerations of this textual convention in this RFC
should take the names (&quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;) as the definitive settings, and
should disregard the numeric values when stated incorrectly.




(1)  [plaintext flaw]

In the final paragraph of Section 7, on page 8, RFC 4327 says:

   In parallel with the entry created in the lmpTeLinkTable, an entry
   may be created in the teLinkTable of TE Link MIB module
   [RFC4220].

It should better say:

|  may be created in the teLinkTable of the TE Link MIB module
   [RFC4220].
                                       ^^^^^

(2)  [plaintext flaw]

In the second paragraph of Section 8, at the bottom of page 8,
RFC 4327 says:

                        [...].  The interrelation of entries in the
   ifTable is defined by Interfaces Stack Group defined in [RFC2863].

It should say:

|  ifTable is defined by the Interfaces Stack Group defined in
   [RFC2863].
                        ^^^^^


(3)  LmpInterval TEXTUAL-CONVENTION  (page 12)

The clause,

   DESCRIPTION
       &quot;The interval delay in milliseconds.&quot;

perhaps should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
|      &quot;The delay interval in milliseconds.&quot;

or even:

   DESCRIPTION
|      &quot;The interval period for a periodically performed LMP operation,

(4)  LmpRetransmitInterval TEXTUAL-CONVENTION  (page 12)

The clause,

   DESCRIPTION
       &quot;The retransmission interval delay in milliseconds.&quot;

perhaps should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
|      &quot;The retransmission delay interval in milliseconds.&quot;

or even better:

   DESCRIPTION
|      &quot;The (initial) retransmission interval in milliseconds.&quot;


(5)  lmpNbrRetransmitInterval OBJECT-TYPE  (page 14)

The sentence in the DESCRIPTION clause,

   &quot;[...]  This object ... is used to implement congestion-handling
   mechanism as defined in Section 10 of the Link Management Protocol
   specification, which is based on RFC 2914.&quot;

should perhaps better say:

   DESCRIPTION
       &quot;This value represents the remote control channel IP address
        type.  In point-to-point configuration, this value can be set
        to unknown(0).&quot;

should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
       &quot;This value represents the remote control channel IP address

        to unknown(0).&quot;

  change for the next object -- see (8) below.]


(8)  lmpCcRemoteIpAddr OBJECT-TYPE  (page 20)

   DESCRIPTION
       &quot;[...]
        Control channel must be numbered on non-point-to-point
        configuration.  For point-to-point configuration, the
        remote control channel address can be of type unknown
        in which case this object must be a zero-length string.  The
        lmpCcRemoteId object then identifies the unnumbered
        address.&quot;
   ::= { lmpControlChannelEntry 7 }

should better say:

   DESCRIPTION
       &quot;[...]
|       The control channel must be numbered on non-point-to-point

        lmpCcRemoteId object then identifies the unnumbered
        address.&quot;
   ::= { lmpControlChannelEntry 7 }


(11)  lmpControlChannelPerfEntry OBJECT-TYPE  (page 24)

   DESCRIPTION
       &quot;An entry in this table is created by a LMP-enabled device for
        every control channel.  lmpCcCounterDiscontinuityTime is used
        to indicate potential discontinuity for all counter objects
        in this table.&quot;

The latter is not true.
In this MIB module, the discontinuity is monitored per table *entry*
(conceptual row), not for the table as a whole -- see the DESCRIPTIONs
for lmp&lt;*&gt;DiscontinuityTime later in the RFC.

Therefore, the above clause should say:

   DESCRIPTION
       &quot;An entry in this table is created by a LMP-enabled device for
        every control channel.  lmpCcCounterDiscontinuityTime is used
        to indicate potential discontinuity for all counter objects

(12)  lmpCcChannelStatusAckSent OBJECT-TYPE  (page 34)

The clause,

   DESCRIPTION
       &quot;This object counts the number of ChannelStatus messages
        that have been sent on this control channel.&quot;
   ::= { lmpControlChannelPerfEntry 47 }

refers to the wrong message type; it should say:

       &quot;This object counts the number of TestStatusFailure messages
        that have been retransmitted for this TE link.&quot;
   ::= { lmpTeLinkPerfEntry 20 }

[ According to Section 12.5.8. of the LMP specification [RFC 4204],
  LMP TestStatusFailure messages are transmitted over the control
  channel; hence, &quot;retransmitted *on* this TE Link&quot; is wrong! ]

        of 1 minute with no more than 10% of the links failed at any
        given time would have 1 notification per second sent from
        each node, or 100 notifications per second for the whole
        network.  The rest of the notifications are negligible
        compared to this number.

        To alleviate the congestion problem, the
        lmpNotificationMaxRate object can be used to implement a
        throttling mechanism.  It is also possible to enable/disable
        certain type of notifications.

It should say, correcting two flaws (line breaks adjusted):

   In this section, we provide a brief example of using the MIB
   objects described in section 9 to set up an LMP control channel.
   While this example is not meant to illustrate every nuance of the
   MIB module, it is intended as an aid to understanding some of the
   key concepts.  It is meant to be read after going through the MIB
   itself.

   Suppose that one would like to form an LMP adjacency between two
   nodes using two control channels.  Suppose also that there are
   three data-bearing links.  We also assume that the data-bearing
   links are ports (lambdas).  We also assume that the link
   verification procedure is not enabled.  The following example
   illustrates which rows and corresponding objects might be created
   to accomplish this.

   First, LMP must be enabled between the pair of nodes.

   }

   Then, the control channels must be set up.  These are created in
   the lmpControlChannelTable.

   In lmpControlChannelTable:
   {
      lmpCcId                           = 1,

      lmpCcRowStatus                    = createAndGo(4),
      lmpCcStorageType                  = nonVolatile(3)
   }

   {
      lmpCcId                           = 2,
      lmpCcUnderlyingIfIndex            = 2,
      lmpCcIsIf                         = false(1),
      lmpCcAuthentication               = false(1),
      lmpCcHelloInterval                = 15,
      lmpCcHelloIntervalMin             = 15,

      lmpCcStorageType                  = nonVolatile(3)
   }

   Next, the three data-bearing links are created.  For each data-
   bearing link, an ifEntry with the same ifIndex needs to be created
   beforehand.

   Note that the data-bearing link type (lmpDataLinkType) does
   not need to be provisioned as it is automatically populated by the
   node.  The definition of the protection role (primary or
   secondary) for the data-bearing links is stored in the
   componentLinkTable of the TE Link MIB module [RFC4220].

   Then, a TE link is created as an ifEntry with ifType teLink in
   the ifTable.

   Once the TE link is created in the ifTable, a TE link entry
   is created in the LMP MIB module to specify TE link information
   specific to LMP.

   In lmpTeLinkTable:
   {
      ifIndex                     = 20,

      lmpTeLinkRowStatus          = createAndGo(4),
      lmpTeLinkStorageType        = nonVolatile(3)
   }

   and in lmpLinkVerificationTable:
   {
      ifIndex                         = 20,
      lmpLinkVerifyInterval           = 100,

      lmpLinkVerifyRowStatus          = createAndGo(4),
      lmpLinkVerifyStorageType        = nonVolatile(3)
   }

   The association between the data-bearing links and the TE links is
   stored in the ifStackTable [RFC2863].

   In parallel with the entry created in the lmpTeLinkTable, an entry
   may be created in the teLinkTable of TE Link MIB module
   [RFC4220].

8.  Application of the Interfaces Group to LMP

   The Interfaces Group [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  This memo contains the media-specific
   extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing LMP control channels
   that are modeled as interfaces.  If the control channel as defined in
   the lmpControlChannelTable is modeled as an ifEntry, then the
   following definition applies.  An lmpControlChannelTable entry is
   designated as being represented as an Interfaces MIB ifEntry if the
   lmpControlChannelEntry object lmpCcIsIf is set to true (2).  In this
   case, the control channel SHOULD be modeled as an ifEntry and
   provide appropriate interface stacking as defined below.

   This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be
   in accordance with [RFC2863], which states that the interfaces table
   (ifTable) contains information on the managed resource&#39;s
   interfaces and that each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of
   a network interface is considered an interface.  Since the LMP
   interface only carries control traffic, it is considered to be below
   the internetwork layer.  Thus, the LMP interface may be represented
   as an entry in the ifTable.  The interrelation of entries in the
   ifTable is defined by Interfaces Stack Group defined in [RFC2863].



Dubuc, et al.               Standards Track                     [Page 8]

RFC 4327                     LMP-MIB Module                 January 2006


   When LMP control channels are modeled as interfaces, the interface
   stack table must appear as follows for the LMP control channel
   interfaces:

   +----------------------------------------+
   | LMP-interface ifType = lmp(227)        +
   +----------------------------------------+
   | Underlying Layer...                    +
   +----------------------------------------+

   In the above diagram, &quot;Underlying Layer...&quot; refers to the ifIndex
   of any interface type over which the LMP interface will transmit
   its traffic.  Note that if the underlying layer provides multiple
   access to its media (i.e., Ethernet), then it is possible to stack
   multiple LMP interfaces on top of this interface in parallel.

   Note that it is not a requirement that LMP control channels be
   modeled as interfaces.  It is acceptable that control channels
   simply exist as logical connections between adjacent LMP-capable
   nodes.  In this case, lmpCcIsIf is set to false(2) and no
   corresponding entry is made in the ifTable.

8.1.  Support of the LMP Layer by ifTable

   Some specific interpretations of ifTable for the LMP layer
   follow.

                 running in some diagnostic testing mode on this
                 interface.  Also see [RFC2863].

   ifOperStatus  This value reflects the actual or operational
                 status of LMP on this interface.

       &quot;This table specifies the LMP-specific TE link information.
        Overall TE link information is kept in three separate tables:
        ifTable for interface-specific information, lmpTeLinkTable
        for LMP specific information, and teLinkTable for generic
        TE link information.  ifIndex is the common index to all

   DESCRIPTION
       &quot;An entry in this table exists for each ifEntry with an
        ifType of teLink(200) that is managed by LMP.  An ifEntry with
        an ifIndex must exist before the corresponding lmpTeLinkEntry is
        created.  If a TE link entry in the ifTable is destroyed, then
        so is the corresponding entry in the lmpTeLinkTable.  The
        administrative status value is controlled from the ifEntry.
        Setting the administrative status to testing prompts LMP to
        start link verification on the TE link.  Information about the
        TE link that is not LMP specific is contained in teLinkTable of
        the TE-LINK-STD-MIB MIB module.&quot;

lmpNotificationMaxRate OBJECT-TYPE
   SYNTAX       Unsigned32
   MAX-ACCESS   read-write
   STATUS       current
   DESCRIPTION
       &quot;The LMP notification rate depends on the size of the network,
        the type of links, the network configuration, the
        reliability of the network, etc.

        When designing this MIB, care has been taken to minimize the
        amount of notifications generated for LMP purposes.  Wherever
        possible, notifications are state driven, meaning the
        notifications are sent only when the system changes state.
        The only notifications that are repeated and could cause a
        problem as far as congestion is concerned are the ones
        associated with data link verification.
        Without any considerations to handling of these
        notifications, a problem may arise if the number of data
        links is high.  Since the data link verification notifications
        can happen only once per data link per link verification
        interval, the notification rate should be sustainable if one



Dubuc, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 57]

RFC 4327                     LMP-MIB Module                 January 2006


        chooses an appropriate link verification interval for a given
        network configuration.  For instance, a network of 100 nodes
        with 5 links of 128 wavelengths each and a link verification
        of 1 minute with no more than 10% of the links failed at any
        given time would have 1 notification per second sent from
        each node, or 100 notifications per second for the whole
        network.  The rest of the notifications are negligible
        compared to this number.

        To alleviate the congestion problem, the
        lmpNotificationMaxRate object can be used to implement a
        throttling mechanism.  It is also possible to enable/disable
        certain type of notifications.

        This variable indicates the maximum number of
        notifications issued per minute.  If events occur
        more rapidly, the implementation may simply fail to
        emit these notifications during that period, or may
        queue them until an appropriate time.  A value of 0
        means no throttling is applied and events may be
        notified at the rate at which they occur.

   DESCRIPTION
       &quot;This notification is generated when a TE link property
        mismatch is detected on the node.  The received remote TE link
        ID of the misconfigured TE link is represented by either
        teLinkRemoteIpAddr or teLinkIncomingIfId depending on whether
        the TE link is numbered or unnumbered.  This notification
        should not be sent unless lmpLinkPropertyNotificationsEnabled

        The remote entity interface ID is the remote entity
        interface ID received in the LinkSummary message.
        This notification should not be sent unless
        lmpLinkPropertyNotificationsEnabled is true.  It is
        recommended that this notification be reported only the

10.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   -   Unauthorized changes to the lmpNbrTable, lmpControlChannelTable,
       lmpTeLinkTable, and lmpDataLinkTable may disrupt allocation of
       resources in the network.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   -   The lmpNbrTable exposes network provider&#39;s node IP addresses.

   -   lmpControlChannelTable exposes network provider&#39;s control
       network.

   -   lmpDataLinkTable exposes network provider&#39;s data network.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

RFC 4327                     LMP-MIB Module                 January 2006


   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
