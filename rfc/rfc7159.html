     The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format

Abstract

   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based,
   language-independent data interchange format.  It was derived from
   the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard.  JSON defines a small
   set of formatting rules for the portable representation of structured
   data.

   This document removes inconsistencies with other specifications of
   JSON, repairs specification errors, and offers experience-based
   interoperability guidance.

1.  Introduction

   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a text format for the
   serialization of structured data.  It is derived from the object
   literals of JavaScript, as defined in the ECMAScript Programming
   Language Standard, Third Edition [ECMA-262].

   JSON can represent four primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans,
   and null) and two structured types (objects and arrays).

   A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters [UNICODE].
   Note that this citation references the latest version of Unicode
   rather than a specific release.  It is not expected that future
   changes in the UNICODE specification will impact the syntax of JSON.

   An object is an unordered collection of zero or more name/value
   pairs, where a name is a string and a value is a string, number,
   boolean, null, object, or array.

   An array is an ordered sequence of zero or more values.

   The terms &quot;object&quot; and &quot;array&quot; come from the conventions of
   JavaScript.

   JSON&#39;s design goals were for it to be minimal, portable, textual, and
   a subset of JavaScript.

The link at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159 says it obsoletes RFC 4627.  I believe this is the intent and result of RFC 7159, and that RFC 4627 need not be consulted except for historical reasons going forward.

</i></div><pre>
A description of JSON in ECMAScript terms appears in Version 5.1 of
   the ECMAScript specification [ECMA-262], Section 15.12.  JSON is also
   described in [ECMA-404].

   All of the specifications of JSON syntax agree on the syntactic
   elements of the language.

1.3.  Introduction to This Revision

   In the years since the publication of RFC 4627, JSON has found very
   wide use.  This experience has revealed certain patterns, which,
   while allowed by its specifications, have caused interoperability
   problems.

   Also, a small number of errata have been reported (see RFC Errata IDs
   607 [Err607] and 3607 [Err3607]).

   This document&#39;s goal is to apply the errata, remove inconsistencies
   with other specifications of JSON, and highlight practices that can
   lead to interoperability problems.

2.  JSON Grammar

   A JSON text is a sequence of tokens.  The set of tokens includes six
   structural characters, strings, numbers, and three literal names.

   A JSON text is a serialized value.  Note that certain previous
   specifications of JSON constrained a JSON text to be an object or an

RFC 7159                          JSON                        March 2014


   array.  Implementations that generate only objects or arrays where a
   JSON text is called for will be interoperable in the sense that all
   implementations will accept these as conforming JSON texts.

      JSON-text = ws value ws

   These are the six structural characters:

      begin-array     = ws %x5B ws  ; [ left square bracket

      begin-object    = ws %x7B ws  ; { left curly bracket

      end-array       = ws %x5D ws  ; ] right square bracket

      end-object      = ws %x7D ws  ; } right curly bracket

      name-separator  = ws %x3A ws  ; : colon

      value-separator = ws %x2C ws  ; , comma

   Insignificant whitespace is allowed before or after any of the six
   structural characters.

      ws = *(
              %x20 /              ; Space
              %x09 /              ; Horizontal tab
              %x0A /              ; Line feed or New line
              %x0D )              ; Carriage return

3.  Values

   A JSON value MUST be an object, array, number, or string, or one of
   the following three literal names:

      false null true

   The literal names MUST be lowercase.  No other literal names are
   allowed.

      value = false / null / true / object / array / number / string

      false = %x66.61.6c.73.65   ; false

      null  = %x6e.75.6c.6c      ; null

      true  = %x74.72.75.65      ; true

RFC 7159                          JSON                        March 2014


4.  Objects

   An object structure is represented as a pair of curly brackets
   surrounding zero or more name/value pairs (or members).  A name is a
   string.  A single colon comes after each name, separating the name
   from the value.  A single comma separates a value from a following
   name.  The names within an object SHOULD be unique.

      object = begin-object [ member *( value-separator member ) ]
               end-object

      member = string name-separator value

   An object whose names are all unique is interoperable in the sense
   that all software implementations receiving that object will agree on
   the name-value mappings.  When the names within an object are not
   unique, the behavior of software that receives such an object is
   unpredictable.  Many implementations report the last name/value pair
   only.  Other implementations report an error or fail to parse the
   object, and some implementations report all of the name/value pairs,
   including duplicates.

   JSON parsing libraries have been observed to differ as to whether or
   not they make the ordering of object members visible to calling
   software.  Implementations whose behavior does not depend on member
   ordering will be interoperable in the sense that they will not be
   affected by these differences.

5.  Arrays

   An array structure is represented as square brackets surrounding zero
   or more values (or elements).  Elements are separated by commas.

   array = begin-array [ value *( value-separator value ) ] end-array

   There is no requirement that the values in an array be of the same
   type.

6.  Numbers

   The representation of numbers is similar to that used in most
   programming languages.  A number is represented in base 10 using
   decimal digits.  It contains an integer component that may be
   prefixed with an optional minus sign, which may be followed by a
   fraction part and/or an exponent part.  Leading zeros are not
   allowed.

   A fraction part is a decimal point followed by one or more digits.



Bray                         Standards Track                    [Page 6]

RFC 7159                          JSON                        March 2014


   An exponent part begins with the letter E in upper or lower case,
   which may be followed by a plus or minus sign.  The E and optional
   sign are followed by one or more digits.

   Numeric values that cannot be represented in the grammar below (such
   as Infinity and NaN) are not permitted.

      number = [ minus ] int [ frac ] [ exp ]

      decimal-point = %x2E       ; .

      digit1-9 = %x31-39         ; 1-9

      e = %x65 / %x45            ; e E

      exp = e [ minus / plus ] 1*DIGIT

      frac = decimal-point 1*DIGIT

      int = zero / ( digit1-9 *DIGIT )

      minus = %x2D               ; -

      plus = %x2B                ; +

      zero = %x30                ; 0

   This specification allows implementations to set limits on the range
   and precision of numbers accepted.  Since software that implements
   IEEE 754-2008 binary64 (double precision) numbers [IEEE754] is
   generally available and widely used, good interoperability can be
   achieved by implementations that expect no more precision or range
   than these provide, in the sense that implementations will
   approximate JSON numbers within the expected precision.  A JSON
   number such as 1E400 or 3.141592653589793238462643383279 may indicate
   potential interoperability problems, since it suggests that the
   software that created it expects receiving software to have greater
   capabilities for numeric magnitude and precision than is widely
   available.

   Note that when such software is used, numbers that are integers and
   are in the range [-(2**53)+1, (2**53)-1] are interoperable in the
   sense that implementations will agree exactly on their numeric
   values.

7.  Strings

   The representation of strings is similar to conventions used in the C
   family of programming languages.  A string begins and ends with
   quotation marks.  All Unicode characters may be placed within the
   quotation marks, except for the characters that must be escaped:
   quotation mark, reverse solidus, and the control characters (U+0000
   through U+001F).

   Any character may be escaped.  If the character is in the Basic
   Multilingual Plane (U+0000 through U+FFFF), then it may be
   represented as a six-character sequence: a reverse solidus, followed
   by the lowercase letter u, followed by four hexadecimal digits that
   encode the character&#39;s code point.  The hexadecimal letters A though
   F can be upper or lower case.  So, for example, a string containing
   only a single reverse solidus character may be represented as
   &quot;\u005C&quot;.

   Alternatively, there are two-character sequence escape
   representations of some popular characters.  So, for example, a
   string containing only a single reverse solidus character may be
   represented more compactly as &quot;\\&quot;.

   To escape an extended character that is not in the Basic Multilingual
   Plane, the character is represented as a 12-character sequence,
   encoding the UTF-16 surrogate pair.  So, for example, a string
   containing only the G clef character (U+1D11E) may be represented as
   &quot;\uD834\uDD1E&quot;.

      string = quotation-mark *char quotation-mark

      char = unescaped /
          escape (
              %x22 /          ; &quot;    quotation mark  U+0022
              %x5C /          ; \    reverse solidus U+005C
              %x2F /          ; /    solidus         U+002F
              %x62 /          ; b    backspace       U+0008
              %x66 /          ; f    form feed       U+000C
              %x6E /          ; n    line feed       U+000A
              %x72 /          ; r    carriage return U+000D
              %x74 /          ; t    tab             U+0009
              %x75 4HEXDIG )  ; uXXXX                U+XXXX

      escape = %x5C              ; \

      quotation-mark = %x22      ; &quot;

      unescaped = %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-10FFFF

8.  String and Character Issues

8.1.  Character Encoding

   JSON text SHALL be encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.  The default
   encoding is UTF-8, and JSON texts that are encoded in UTF-8 are
   interoperable in the sense that they will be read successfully by the
   maximum number of implementations; there are many implementations
   that cannot successfully read texts in other encodings (such as
   UTF-16 and UTF-32).

   Implementations MUST NOT add a byte order mark to the beginning of a
   JSON text.  In the interests of interoperability, implementations
   that parse JSON texts MAY ignore the presence of a byte order mark
   rather than treating it as an error.

8.2.  Unicode Characters

   When all the strings represented in a JSON text are composed entirely
   of Unicode characters [UNICODE] (however escaped), then that JSON
   text is interoperable in the sense that all software implementations
   that parse it will agree on the contents of names and of string
   values in objects and arrays.

   However, the ABNF in this specification allows member names and
   string values to contain bit sequences that cannot encode Unicode
   characters; for example, &quot;\uDEAD&quot; (a single unpaired UTF-16
   surrogate).  Instances of this have been observed, for example, when
   a library truncates a UTF-16 string without checking whether the
   truncation split a surrogate pair.  The behavior of software that
   receives JSON texts containing such values is unpredictable; for
   example, implementations might return different values for the length
   of a string value or even suffer fatal runtime exceptions.

8.3.  String Comparison

   Software implementations are typically required to test names of
   object members for equality.  Implementations that transform the
   textual representation into sequences of Unicode code units and then
   perform the comparison numerically, code unit by code unit, are
   interoperable in the sense that implementations will agree in all
   cases on equality or inequality of two strings.  For example,
   implementations that compare strings with escaped characters
   unconverted may incorrectly find that &quot;a\\b&quot; and &quot;a\u005Cb&quot; are not
   equal.

9.  Parsers

   A JSON parser transforms a JSON text into another representation.  A
   JSON parser MUST accept all texts that conform to the JSON grammar.
   A JSON parser MAY accept non-JSON forms or extensions.

   An implementation may set limits on the size of texts that it
   accepts.  An implementation may set limits on the maximum depth of
   nesting.  An implementation may set limits on the range and precision
   of numbers.  An implementation may set limits on the length and
   character contents of strings.

10.  Generators

   A JSON generator produces JSON text.  The resulting text MUST
   strictly conform to the JSON grammar.

11.  IANA Considerations

   The MIME media type for JSON text is application/json.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  json

   Required parameters:  n/a

   Optional parameters:  n/a

      Clojure, ColdFusion, Common Lisp, E, Erlang, Go, Java, JavaScript,
      Lua, Objective CAML, Perl, PHP, Python, Rebol, Ruby, Scala, and

   Since JSON's syntax is borrowed from JavaScript, it is possible to

   Since JSON's syntax is borrowed from JavaScript, it is possible to
   use that language's &quot;eval()&quot; function to parse most (but not all)
   JSON texts.
</pre><i><b>Errata Notes: </b>

This wording may be construed as meaning that every compliant JSON text is parseable as JavaScript, which is not the case: &lt;http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset&gt;. (Actually I would prefer this to be stated clearly elsewhere in the document, e.g. where it says &quot;JSON's design goals were for it to be [...] a subset of JavaScript&quot;.)

 --VERIFIER NOTES-- 
As per the above citation, there are characters (in particular line terminators like U+2028 and U+2029) which are permissible in JSON but not permissible in JavaScript. The corrected text makes this clearer.

</i></div><pre>

   Generally, there are security issues with scripting languages.  JSON
   is a subset of JavaScript but excludes assignment and invocation.

   Since JSON&#39;s syntax is borrowed from JavaScript, it is possible to
   use that language&#39;s &quot;eval()&quot; function to parse JSON texts.  This
   generally constitutes an unacceptable security risk, since the text
   could contain executable code along with data declarations.  The same
   consideration applies to the use of eval()-like functions in any
   other programming language in which JSON texts conform to that
   language&#39;s syntax.

   Its Image member is an object whose Thumbnail member is an object and
   whose IDs member is an array of numbers.

   This is a JSON array containing two objects:

   RFC 4627 was written by Douglas Crockford.  This document was
   constructed by making a relatively small number of changes to that
   document; thus, the vast majority of the text here is his.

Appendix A.  Changes from RFC 4627

</pre><div style='overflow:auto;border:dashed;margin:8px;padding:24px;background-color:#FFFFAF;'><b><i>Editorial <a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid4336'>Errata 4336</a> updates this section as follows:</i></b><br/><br/><i><b>Old Text:</b></i><br/><pre style='margin:20px'>


[NO MENTION OF SECTION 3 OF RFC 4627]
</pre><br/><i><b>New Text:</b></i><br/><pre style='margin:20px'>

   o  Removed method of detection of character encoding from
      section 3 &quot;Encoding&quot; of RFC 4627.

       
</pre><i><b>Errata Notes: </b>

Appendix 1 (listing changes between RFC 4627 and RFC 7159) does not include any comment on the removal of this text from RFC 4627 section 3:

[START QUOTE]
   Since the first two characters of a JSON text will always be ASCII
   characters [RFC0020], it is possible to determine whether an octet
   stream is UTF-8, UTF-16 (BE or LE), or UTF-32 (BE or LE) by looking
   at the pattern of nulls in the first four octets.

           00 00 00 xx  UTF-32BE
           00 xx 00 xx  UTF-16BE
           xx 00 00 00  UTF-32LE
           xx 00 xx 00  UTF-16LE
           xx xx xx xx  UTF-8
[END QUOTE]


The new section 8.1 &quot;Character encoding&quot; states that:

[START QUOTE]
JSON text SHALL be encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32
[END QUOTE]

but, unlike RFC 4627 section 3, it does not say anything about how to distinguish which has been used when parsing a byte string as JSON.


RFC 7159 section 8.1 also says:

[START QUOTE]
   Implementations MUST NOT add a byte order mark to the beginning of a
   JSON text.
[END QUOTE]

which rules out using a byte order mark for this purpose.


Additionally, RFC 7159 section 11 says:

[START QUOTE]
   Note:  No &quot;charset&quot; parameter is defined for this registration.
      Adding one really has no effect on compliant recipients.
[END QUOTE]

which rules out one means of communicating which character encoding is in use when communicating JSON over HTTP (namely a charset parameter on the media type), and implies that there is another means of detecting the character encoding, but does not say what it is.


I've reported this as an erratum on the appendix, as I expect there is an existing means of detecting which of the Unicode character encodings are in use, but I was expecting the appendix to reference it as part of an explanation of the removal of the text I quoted from RFC 4627 section 3 but no such explanation is present. It may be the case that the erratum ought to be against section 8.1 to provide a reference there.

   This section lists changes between this document and the text in RFC
   4627.

   o  Changed the title and abstract of the document.

   o  Changed the reference to [UNICODE] to be not version specific.

   o  Added a &quot;Specifications of JSON&quot; section.

   o  Added an &quot;Introduction to This Revision&quot; section.

   o  Changed the definition of &quot;JSON text&quot; so that it can be any JSON
      value, removing the constraint that it be an object or array.

   o  Added language about duplicate object member names, member
      ordering, and interoperability.

   o  Clarified the absence of a requirement that values in an array be
      of the same JSON type.

   o  Applied erratum #607 from RFC 4627 to correctly align the artwork
      for the definition of &quot;object&quot;.

   o  Changed &quot;as sequences of digits&quot; to &quot;in the grammar below&quot; in the
      &quot;Numbers&quot; section, and made base-10-ness explicit.

   o  Added language about number interoperability as a function of
      IEEE754, and added an IEEE754 reference.

   o  Added language about interoperability and Unicode characters and
      about string comparisons.  To do this, turned the old &quot;Encoding&quot;
      section into a &quot;String and Character Issues&quot; section, with three
      subsections: &quot;Character Encoding&quot;, &quot;Unicode Characters&quot;, and
      &quot;String Comparison&quot;.

   o  Changed guidance in the &quot;Parsers&quot; section to point out that
      implementations may set limits on the range &quot;and precision&quot; of
      numbers.

   o  Updated and tidied the &quot;IANA Considerations&quot; section.

   o  Made a real &quot;Security Considerations&quot; section and lifted the text
      out of the previous &quot;IANA Considerations&quot; section.

RFC 7159                          JSON                        March 2014


   o  Applied erratum #3607 from RFC 4627 by removing the security
      consideration that begins &quot;A JSON text can be safely passed&quot; and
      the JavaScript code that went with that consideration.

   o  Added a note to the &quot;Security Considerations&quot; section pointing out
      the risks of using the &quot;eval()&quot; function in JavaScript or any
      other language in which JSON texts conform to that language&#39;s
      syntax.

   o  Added a note to the &quot;IANA Considerations&quot; clarifying the absence
      of a &quot;charset&quot; parameter for the application/json media type.

   o  Changed &quot;100&quot; to 100 and added a boolean field, both in the first
      example.

   o  Added examples of JSON texts with simple values, neither objects
      nor arrays.

   o  Added a &quot;Contributors&quot; section crediting Douglas Crockford.

   o  Added a reference to RFC 4627.

   o  Moved the ECMAScript reference from Normative to Informative and
      updated it to reference ECMAScript 5.1, and added a reference to
      ECMA 404.
