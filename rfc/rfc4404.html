1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Overview of FCIP Management Model

   Note that the Fibre Channel Over TCP/IP (FCIP) Entity is fully
   described in [RFC3821] from a functional point of view.  A collection
   of multiple instances of FCIP Entities and the corresponding FC
   Entities, described in [FCBB2], within an SNMP Context is referred to
   as an FCIP device here.  This section describes FCIP from a
   management point of view.

        +------------------------------------------+

   The FCIP device provides an IP-based interconnection model for
   interconnecting FC fabric elements.  In this model, the FCIP devices
   along with the IP network on which they are running provide a new
   FCIP transport network.

   This IP-based FCIP Interconnection Model supports the following
   topology:

   o The FCIP-based transport network is formed by interconnecting the
     FCIP devices.

RFC 4404                        FCIP MIB                   February 2006


   o Each FCIP device has one or more FCIP Entities or Instances.

   o Peer FCIP Entities are connected by FCIP Links attached to
     VE_ports/B_Access.

   o Each FCIP Link Endpoint contains one or more Data Engines.

   o The FCIP device can work as a stand-alone box or as part of a FC
     fabric element.

   Each FCIP Entity managed by this MIB is referred to as an FCIP
   Instance.  The MIB is broken up as follows:

2.1.  FCIP Entity Instances Table

                                        ^^^^^^

from pending

</i></div><pre>

   The FCIP Entity table contains information about this entity&#39;s
   existing instances of FCIP entities.

2.2.  FCIP Link Table

   The FCIP link table contains information about this FCIP device&#39;s
   existing FCIP links.

2.3.  FCIP TCP Connection Table

   The FCIP TCP Connection table contains information about existing TCP
   connections.  Each FCIP link within an FCIP entity contains one or
   more TCP connections.  The FCIP entity employs a Data Engine for each
   TCP connection for handling FC frame encapsulation, de-encapsulation,
   and transmission of FCIP frames on the connection.

2.4.  FCIP Dynamic Route Table

   The FCIP dynamic route table contains routing information that is
   dynamically discovered by this FCIP device.  The FCIP device may use
   the SLPv2 protocol [RFC3822] in conjunction with other protocols,
   such as Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF), to dynamically discover
   other FCIP entities and populate this table to map destination
   domains to FCIP Links.

2.5.  FCIP Static Route Table

   The FCIP static route table contains routing information that is
   statically configured into this FCIP device by the Network Admin.  In
   the absence of dynamic discovery of remote FCIP entities, the Network
   Manager can configure remote domains and FCIP Entities that are
   reachable by this device into this table.




Natarajan &amp; Rijhsinghani    Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 4404                        FCIP MIB                   February 2006


   At any point in time, both the static and dynamic routing tables can
   be active.  If a DID is present in both tables, information in the
   static route table will take precedence over the entry in the dynamic
   route table for the same DID.

2.6.  FCIP Discovery Domain Table

   The FCIP Discovery Domain Table maps this device&#39;s FCIP Entities into
   FCIP Discovery Domains.

2.7.  FCIP Link Error Table

   The FCIP Link Errors Table contains counters that indicate error
   conditions on an FCIP Link.

3.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   Objects accessible from other MIB modules applicable to FCIP devices
   have not been included in this MIB module.  The following subsections
   list all applicable MIB modules that should be present with FCIP-
   MGMT-MIB.

3.1.  Relationship to the &#39;TCP&#39; Group

   This group is mandatory for all systems that implement TCP.  Objects
   relevant to TCP must be obtained from this group [RFC4022].

3.2.  Relationship to the &#39;interfaces&#39; MIB

   The &#39;interfaces&#39; group is defined as being mandatory for all systems
   and contains information on an entity&#39;s interfaces.  Each
   logical/virtual interface created as an FCIP Link should be
   represented as a row in the ifTable with a unique ifIndex value and a
   value of ifType &#39;fcipLink&#39; (224) for each such interface.  For a
   complete list of interface types, refer to the IANA registry at
   &quot;http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers&quot;.  These are the only
   ifIndex values of relevance to an FCIP Entity because FCIP runs on
   top of TCP/IP.

   FCIP runs over TCP.  Thus, by definition, there is no ifTable
   interface directly beneath it, and so ifStackLowerLayer is always 0.
   For any protocol using FCIP (i.e., above FCIP), FCIP appears to be a
   regular FC interface.  As stated in [RFC4044], a regular &quot;FC
   interface will typically have no other ifTable rows stacked on top of
   it&quot;, and thus, ifStackHigherLayer is typically zero.

3.3.  Relationship to the Fibre Channel Management MIB

   The Fibre Channel Management MIB [RFC4044] is assumed for FC
   functionality managed objects.

3.4.  Specific Interface Group MIB Objects

   The following table provides specific implementation guidelines for
   applying the objects defined in the Interfaces Group MIB to FCIP
   Links.  For those objects not listed here, refer to their generic
   definitions in [RFC2863].

    Object                   Guidelines

   ifType                   &#39;fcipLink&#39; (224)

   ifSpeed                  The ifSpeed for the physical interface(s)
                            over which the FCIP Link runs.

   ifPhysAddress            There is no physical address corresponding
                            to an FCIP Link (only World Wide Name, WWN).
                            Reported as 0.

   ifAdminStatus            Write access is not required, and support
                            for &#39;testing&#39; is not required.

   ifOperStatus             Support for &#39;testing&#39; is not required.
                            The value &#39;dormant&#39; has no meaning for
                            FCIP Links.

   ifInOctets               The number of octets of FCIP information
   ifHCInOctets             contained in received frames in TCP
                            streams, starting with FCIP header.

   ifInUcastPkts            The number of FCIP frames received
   ifHCInUcastPkts          on this FCIP Link.

   ifOutOctets              The number of octets of FCIP information
   ifHCOutOctets            contained in transmitted frames in TCP
                            streams, starting with FCIP header.

   ifOutUcastPkts           The number of FCIP frames transmitted
   ifHCOutUcastPkts         on this FCIP Link.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  In particular, write access to
   fcipDiscoveryDomainName and fcipEntityAddress can cause a loss of
   reachability to portions of the Fibre Channel fabric, while write
   access to fcipStaticRouteStatus can create incorrect routes to remote
   devices.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that contain what
   could be considered as sensitive information.  In particular, the
   objects which provide information on identification and network
   topology:

   fcipDeviceWWN, fcipEntityName, fcipEntityAddress,
   fcipLinkLocalFcipEntityAddress, fcipLinkRemFcipEntityWWN,
   and fcipLinkRemFcipEntityAddress
   -- information on identification;

   fcipDiscoveryDomainName
   -- information on discovery domains;

   fcipDynamicRouteLinkIndex
   -- information on dynamic routes;

   fcipStaticRouteLinkIndex and fcipStaticRouteStatus
   -- information on static routes

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to

   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has assigned a MIB OID assignment under the transmission
   branch.  Specifically, { transmission 224 } for fcipMIB since this
   MIB contains the media-specific definitions that correspond to the
   ifType value of fcipLink(224).
