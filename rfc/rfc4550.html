Abstract

   This document describes a profile (a set of required extensions,
   restrictions, and usage modes) of the IMAP and mail submission
   protocols.  This profile allows clients (especially those that are
   constrained in memory, bandwidth, processing power, or other areas)
   to efficiently use IMAP and Submission to access and submit mail.
   This includes the ability to forward received mail without needing to
   download and upload the mail, to optimize submission, and to
   efficiently resynchronize in case of loss of connectivity with the
   server.

   The Internet Email to Support Diverse Service Environments (Lemonade)
   profile relies upon extensions to IMAP and Mail Submission protocols;
   specifically, the URLAUTH and CATENATE IMAP protocol (RFC 3501)
   extensions and the BURL extension to the SUBMIT protocol (RFC 4409).

RFC 4550                    Lemonade Profile                   June 2006


1.  Introduction

   Lemonade provides enhancements to Internet email to support diverse
   service environments.

   This document describes the Lemonade profile, which includes:

      -  &quot;forward without download&quot;, which describes exchanges between
         Lemonade clients and servers to allow new email messages to be
         submitted incorporating content that resides on locations
         external to the client.

      -  Quick mailbox resynchronization using [CONDSTORE].

      -  Several IMAP and SMTP extensions that save bandwidth and/or
         number of round-trips required to send/receive data.

   The organization of this document is as follows.  Section 2 describes
   &quot;forward without download&quot;.  Section 3 describes additional SMTP
   extensions that must be supported by all Lemonade Submission servers.
   Section 4 describes IMAP quick resynchronization.

2.  Forward without Download

2.1.  Motivations

   The advent of client/server email using the [RFC3501], [RFC2821], and
   [SUBMIT] protocols has changed what formerly were local disk
   operations into repetitive network data transmissions.





Maes &amp; Melnikov             Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 4550                    Lemonade Profile                   June 2006


   Lemonade &quot;forward without download&quot; makes use of the [BURL] SUBMIT
   extension to enable access to external sources during the submission
   of a message.  In combination with the IMAP [URLAUTH] extension,
   inclusion of message parts or even entire messages from the IMAP mail
   store is possible with a minimal trust relationship between the IMAP
   and SMTP SUBMIT servers.

   Lemonade &quot;forward without download&quot; has the advantage of maintaining
   one submission protocol, and thus avoids the risk of having multiple
   parallel and possibly divergent mechanisms for submission.  The
   client can use Submit/SMTP [SUBMIT] extensions without these being
   added to IMAP.  Furthermore, by keeping the details of message
   submission in the SMTP SUBMIT server, Lemonade &quot;forward without
   download&quot; can work with other message retrieval protocols such as
   Post Office Protocol (POP), Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), or
   whatever else may be designed in the future.

2.2.  Message Sending Overview

   The act of sending an email message can be thought of as involving
   multiple steps: initiation of a new draft, draft editing, message
   assembly, and message submission.

   Initiation of a new draft and draft editing takes place in the Mail
   User Agent (MUA).  Frequently, users choose to save more complex
   messages on an [RFC3501] server (via the APPEND command with the
   \Draft flag) for later recall by the MUA and resumption of the
   editing process.

   Message assembly is the process of producing a complete message from
   the final revision of the draft and external sources.  At assembly
   time, external data is retrieved and inserted in the message.

   Message submission is the process of inserting the assembled message
   into the [RFC2821] infrastructure, typically using the [SUBMIT]
   protocol.

2.3.  Traditional Strategy

   Traditionally, messages are initiated, edited, and assembled entirely
   within an MUA, although drafts may be saved to an [RFC3501] server
   and later retrieved from the server.  The completed text is then
   transmitted to a Message Submission Agent (MSA) for delivery.








Maes &amp; Melnikov             Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 4550                    Lemonade Profile                   June 2006


   There is often no clear boundary between the editing and assembly
   process.  If a message is forwarded, its content is often retrieved
   immediately and inserted into the message text.  Similarly, when
   external content is inserted or attached, the content is usually
   retrieved immediately and made part of the draft.

   As a consequence, each save of a draft and subsequent retrieve of the
   draft transmits that entire (possibly large) content, as does message
   submission.

   In the past, this was not much of a problem, because drafts, external
   data, and the message submission mechanism were typically located on
   the same system as the MUA.  The most common problem was running out
   of disk quota.

2.4.  Step-by-Step Description

   The model distinguishes among a Mail User Agent (MUA), an IMAP4Rev1
   Server ([RFC3501]), and a SMTP submit server ([SUBMIT]), as
   illustrated in Figure 1.

             Figure 1:  Lemonade &quot;forward without download&quot;

   Lemonade &quot;forward without download&quot; allows a Messaging User Agent to
   compose and forward an e-mail combining fragments that are located in
   an IMAP server, without having to download these fragments to the
   client.

RFC 4550                    Lemonade Profile                   June 2006


   There are two ways to perform &quot;forward without download&quot;, based on
   where the message assembly takes place.  The first uses an extended
   APPEND command [CATENATE] to edit a draft message in the message
   store and cause the message assembly on the IMAP server.  The second
   uses a succession of BURL and BDAT commands to submit and assemble
   (through concatenation) message data from the client and external
   data fetched from the provided URL.  The two subsequent sections
   provide step-by-step instructions on how &quot;forward without download&quot;
   is achieved.

2.4.1.  Message Assembly Using IMAP CATENATE Extension

   In the [BURL]/[CATENATE] variant of the Lemonade &quot;forward without
   download&quot; strategy, messages are initially composed and edited within
   an MUA.  The [CATENATE] extension to [RFC3501] is then used to create
   the messages on the IMAP server by transmitting new text and
   assembling them.  The [UIDPLUS] IMAP extension is used by the client
   in order to learn the Unique Identifier (UID) of the created
   messages.  Finally, a [URLAUTH] format URL is given to a [SUBMIT]
   server for submission using the [BURL] extension.

   The flow involved to support such a use case consists of:

      M: {to I -- Optional} The client connects to the IMAP server,
      optionally starts TLS (if data confidentiality is required),
      authenticates, opens a mailbox (&quot;INBOX&quot; in the example below) and
      fetches body structures (See [RFC3501]).

      Example:

            M: A0051 UID FETCH 25627 (UID BODYSTRUCTURE)
            I: * 161 FETCH (UID 25627 BODYSTRUCTURE ((&quot;TEXT&quot; &quot;PLAIN&quot;
               (&quot;CHARSET&quot; &quot;US-ASCII&quot;) NIL NIL &quot;7BIT&quot; 1152 23)(
               &quot;TEXT&quot; &quot;PLAIN&quot; (&quot;CHARSET&quot; &quot;US-ASCII&quot; &quot;NAME&quot;
               &quot;trip.txt&quot;)
               &quot;&lt;960723163407.20117h@washington.example.com&gt;&quot;
               &quot;Your trip details&quot; &quot;BASE64&quot; 4554 73) &quot;MIXED&quot;))
            I: A0051 OK completed

      M: {to I} The client invokes CATENATE (See [CATENATE] for details
      of the semantics and steps) -- this allows the MUA to create
      messages on the IMAP server using new data combined with one or
      more message parts already present on the IMAP server.

      Note that the example for this step doesn&#39;t use the LITERAL+
      [LITERAL+] extension.  Without LITERAL+, the new message is
      constructed using 3 round-trips.  If LITERAL+ is used, the new
      message can be constructed using one round-trip.

         I: A0053 OK STORE completed

      Note: the UID STORE command shown above will only work if the
      marked message is in the currently selected mailbox; otherwise, it
      requires a SELECT.  This command can be omitted.  The untagged
      FETCH response is due to [CONDSTORE].  The $Forwarded IMAP keyword
      is described in Section 2.8.

2.4.2.  Message Assembly Using SMTP CHUNKING and BURL Extensions

   In the [BURL]/[CHUNKING] variant of the Lemonade &quot;forward without
   download&quot; strategy, messages are initially composed and edited within
   an MUA.  During submission [SUBMIT], BURL [BURL] and BDAT [CHUNKING]
   commands are used to create the messages from multiple parts.  New
   body parts are supplied using BDAT commands, while existing body
   parts are referenced using [URLAUTH] format URLs in BURL commands.

   The flow involved to support such a use case consists of:

      M: {to I -- Optional} The client connects to the IMAP server,
      optionally starts TLS (if data confidentiality is required),
      authenticates, opens a mailbox (&quot;INBOX&quot; in the example below), and
      fetches body structures (see [RFC3501]).

      Example:

            M: A0051 UID FETCH 25627 (UID BODYSTRUCTURE)
            I: * 161 FETCH (UID 25627 BODYSTRUCTURE ((&quot;TEXT&quot; &quot;PLAIN&quot;
               (&quot;CHARSET&quot; &quot;US-ASCII&quot;) NIL NIL &quot;7BIT&quot; 1152 23)(
               &quot;TEXT&quot; &quot;PLAIN&quot; (&quot;CHARSET&quot; &quot;US-ASCII&quot; &quot;NAME&quot;
               &quot;trip.txt&quot;)
               &quot;&lt;960723163407.20117h@washington.example.com&gt;&quot;
               &quot;Your trip details&quot; &quot;BASE64&quot; 4554 73) &quot;MIXED&quot;))
            I: A0051 OK completed

      M: {to I} The client uses GENURLAUTH command to request URLAUTH
      URLs (see [URLAUTH]) referencing pieces of the message to be
      assembled.

      I: {to M} The IMAP server returns URLAUTH URLs suitable for later
      retrieval with URLFETCH (see [URLAUTH] for details of the
      semantics and steps).

      Note: the UID STORE command shown above will only work if the
      marked message is in the currently selected mailbox; otherwise, it
      requires a SELECT.  This command can be omitted.  The untagged
      FETCH response is due to [CONDSTORE].  The $Forwarded IMAP keyword
      is described in Section 2.8.

2.5.  Normative Statements Related to Forward without Download

   Lemonade-compliant IMAP servers MUST support IMAP4Rev1 [RFC3501],
   CATENATE [CATENATE], UIDPLUS [UIDPLUS], and URLAUTH [URLAUTH].  This
   support MUST be declared via CAPABILITY [RFC3501].

   Lemonade-compliant submit servers MUST support BURL [BURL], 8BITMIME
   [8BITMIME], BINARYMIME [CHUNKING], and CHUNKING [CHUNKING].  This
   support MUST be declared via EHLO [RFC2821].  BURL MUST support
   URLAUTH type URLs [URLAUTH], and thus MUST advertise the &quot;imap&quot;
   option following the BURL EHLO keyword (see [BURL] for more details).

   Additional normative statements are provided in other sections.

2.6.  Security Considerations for &quot;pawn-tickets&quot;

   The so-called &quot;pawn-ticket&quot; authorization mechanism uses a URI, which
   contains its own authorization credentials using [URLAUTH].  The
   advantage of this mechanism is that the SMTP submit [SUBMIT] server
   cannot access any data on the [RFC3501] server without a &quot;pawn-
   ticket&quot; created by the client.

   The &quot;pawn-ticket&quot; grants access only to the specific data that the
   SMTP submit [SUBMIT] server is authorized to access, can be revoked
   by the client, and can have a time-limited validity.

2.7.  The fcc Problem

   The &quot;fcc problem&quot; refers to delivering a copy of a message to a &quot;file
   carbon copy&quot; recipient.  By far, the most common case of fcc is a
   client leaving a copy of outgoing mail in a &quot;Sent Mail&quot; or &quot;Outbox&quot;
   mailbox.

   In the traditional strategy, the MUA duplicates the effort spent in
   transmitting to the MSA by writing the message to the fcc destination
   in a separate step.  This may be a write to a local disk file or an
   APPEND to a mailbox on an IMAP server.  The latter is one of the
   &quot;repetitive network data transmissions&quot; that represents the &quot;problem&quot;
   aspect of the &quot;fcc problem&quot;.

   The [CATENATE] extension to [RFC3501] can be used to address the fcc
   problem.  The final message is constructed in the mailbox designed
   for outgoing mail.  Note that the [CATENATE] extension can only
   create a single message and only on the server that stages the
   outgoing message for submission.  Additional copies of the message
   can be created on the same server using one or more COPY commands.

2.8.  Registration of $Forwarded IMAP Keyword

   The $Forwarded IMAP keyword is used by several IMAP clients to
   specify that the message was resent to another email address,
   embedded within or attached to a new message.  A mail client sets
   this keyword when it successfully forwards the message to another
   email address.  Typical usage of this keyword is to show a different
   (or additional) icon for a message that has been forwarded.  Once
   set, the flag SHOULD NOT be cleared.

   Lemonade-compliant servers MUST be able to store the $Forwarded
   keyword.  They MUST preserve it on the COPY operation.  The servers
   MUST support the SEARCH KEYWORD $Forwarded.

3.  Message Submission

   Lemonade-compliant mail submission servers are expected to implement
   the following set of SMTP extensions to make message submission
   efficient.

   Lemonade clients should take advantage of these features.

3.1.  Pipelining

   Mobile clients regularly use networks with a relatively high latency.
   Avoidance of round-trips within a transaction has a great advantage
   for reduction in both bandwidth and total transaction time.  For this
   reason, Lemonade-compliant mail submission servers MUST support the
   SMTP Service Extensions for Command Pipelining [RFC2920].

   Clients SHOULD pipeline SMTP commands when possible.

3.2.  DSN Support

   Lemonade-compliant mail submission servers MUST support SMTP service
   extensions for delivery status notifications [RFC3461].

3.3.  Message Size Declaration

   Lemonade-compliant mail submission servers MUST support the SMTP
   Service Extension for Message Size Declaration [RFC1870].

   Lemonade-compliant mail submission servers MUST &quot;expand&quot; all BURL
   parts before enforcing a message size limit.

   A Lemonade-compliant client SHOULD use message size declaration.  In
   particular, it MUST NOT send a message to a mail submission server,
   if the client knows that the message exceeds the maximal message size
   advertised by the submission server.

3.4.  Enhanced Status Code Support

   Lemonade-compliant mail submission servers MUST support SMTP Service
   Extension for Returning Enhanced Error Codes [RFC2034].

3.5.  TLS

   Lemonade-compliant mail submission servers MUST support SMTP Service
   Extension for Secure SMTP over TLS [SMTP-TLS].

4.  Quick Resynchronization

   Lemonade-compliant IMAP servers MUST support the CONDSTORE
   [CONDSTORE] extension.  It allows a client to quickly resynchronize
   any mailbox by asking the server to return all flag changes that have
   occurred since the last known mailbox synchronization mark.

   [IMAP-DISC] shows how to perform quick mailbox resynchronization.

5.  Additional IMAP Extensions

   [NAMESPACE] extension.  The extension allows clients to discover
   shared mailboxes and mailboxes belonging to other users.

   Lemonade-compliant IMAP servers MUST support the LITERAL+ [LITERAL+]
   extension.  The extension allows clients to save a round-trip each
   time a non-synchronizing literal is sent.

   Lemonade-compliant IMAP servers MUST support the IDLE [IDLE]
   extension.  The extension allows clients to receive instant
   notifications about changes in the selected mailbox, without needing
   to poll for changes.

   Lemonade-compliant IMAP servers MUST support IMAP over TLS [RFC3501]
   as required by RFC 3501.

7.  Future work

   The Lemonade Working Group is looking into additional issues related
   to usage of email by mobile devices, possibly including:

      -  Media conversion (static and possibly streamed)
      -  Transport optimization for low or costly bandwidth and less
         reliable mobile networks (e.g., quick reconnect)
      -  Server to client notifications, possibly outside of the
         traditional IMAP band
      -  Dealing with firewall and intermediaries
      -  Compression and other bandwidth optimization
      -  Filtering
      -  Other considerations for mobile clients

8.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations on Lemonade &quot;forward without download&quot; are
   discussed throughout Section 2.  Additional security considerations
   can be found in [RFC3501] and other documents describing other SMTP
   and IMAP extensions comprising the Lemonade profile.

   Note that the mandatory-to-implement authentication mechanism for
   SMTP submission is described in [SUBMIT].  The mandatory-to-implement
   authentication mechanism for IMAP is described in [RFC3501].

8.1.  Confidentiality Protection of Submitted Messages

   When clients submit new messages, link protection such as TLS guards
   against an eavesdropper seeing the contents of the submitted message.
   It&#39;s worth noting, however, that even if TLS is not used, the
   security risks are no worse if BURL is used to reference the text
   than if the text is submitted directly.  If BURL is not used, an
   eavesdropper gains access to the full text of the message.  If BURL
   is used, the eavesdropper may or may not be able to gain such access,
   depending on the form of BURL used.  For example, some forms restrict
   use of the URL to an entity authorized as a submission server or a
   specific user.

8.2.  TLS

   When Lemonade clients use the BURL extension to mail submission,
   which requires sending a URLAUTH token to the mail submission server,
   such a token should be protected from interception to avoid a replay
   attack that may disclose the contents of the message to an attacker.
   TLS-based encryption of the mail submission path will provide
   protection against this attack.

   Lemonade clients SHOULD use TLS-protected IMAP and mail submission
   channels when using BURL-based message submission to protect the
   URLAUTH token from interception.

   Lemonade-compliant mail submission servers SHOULD use TLS-protected
   IMAP connections when fetching message content using the URLAUTH
   token provided by the Lemonade client.

   When a client uses SMTP STARTTLS to send a BURL command that
   references non-public information, there is a user expectation that
   the entire message content will be treated confidentially.  To meet
   this expectation, the message submission server should use STARTTLS
   or a mechanism providing equivalent data confidentiality when
   fetching the content referenced by that URL.
