        Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
   Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:
<font color='red'><s>

      The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL
      NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;,  &quot;MAY&quot;, and
      &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.

       The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL
       NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT 
       RECOMMENDED&quot;,  &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to 
       be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

5. MAY   This word, or the adjective &quot;OPTIONAL&quot;, mean that an item is
   truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a
   particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that
   it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item.
   An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be
   prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does
   include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the
   same vein an implementation which does include a particular option
   MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which
   does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the
   option provides.)

6. Guidance in the use of these Imperatives

   In particular, they MUST only be used where it is actually required
   for interoperation or to limit behavior which has potential for
   causing harm (e.g., limiting retransmisssions)  For example, they
   must not be used to try to impose a particular method on
   implementors where the method is not required for interoperability.

   Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used with care
   and sparingly.  In particular, they MUST only be used where it is
   actually required for interoperation or to limit behavior which has
   potential for causing harm
<font color='red'><s> (e.g., limiting retransmisssions)  </s></font></pre><div style='overflow:auto;border:dashed;margin:8px;padding:24px;background-color:#FFFFAF;'><b><i>The preceding text has been updated by Editorial <a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid494'>Errata 494</a> to instead read:</i></b><pre style='margin:20px'>

</pre></div><pre>
For
   example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method
   on implementors where the method is not required for
   interoperability.

7. Security Considerations

   These terms are frequently used to specify behavior with security
   implications.  The effects on security of not implementing a MUST or
   SHOULD, or doing something the specification says MUST NOT or SHOULD
   NOT be done may be very subtle. Document authors should take the time
   to elaborate the security implications of not following
   recommendations or requirements as most implementors will not have
   had the benefit of the experience and discussion that produced the
   specification.

8. Acknowledgments

   The definitions of these terms are an amalgam of definitions taken
   from a number of RFCs.  In addition, suggestions have been
   incorporated from a number of people including Robert Ullmann, Thomas
   Narten, Neal McBurnett, and Robert Elz.

(3) 3. SHOULD   This word, or the adjective &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, mean

(4) 4. SHOULD NOT   This phrase, or the phrase &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot; mean


It should say:

(1) &quot;The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, and &quot;MAY&quot; means

(4) 4. SHOULD NOT   This phrase means

Editorial note: The use of &quot;mean&quot; after a singular subject is simply wrong.  Subordinate phrases like &quot;, or the term BLATHER,&quot; do nothing to change that.


 

Notes:

RFC 2026, to which RFC 2119 should be subordinate, carefully distinguishes between Technical Specifications (TS) and Applicability Statements (AS).   Its Section 3.3 prescribes specific language to be used in ASs, with categories &quot;Required&quot;, &quot;Recommended&quot;, &quot;Elective&quot;, &quot;Limited Use&quot;, and &quot;Not Recommended&quot;, while 2119's language, especially in its Section 6, fairly clearly apply to interoperability requirements within TS documents.  Use of terms that 2026 requires for AS documents in a TS context (as synonyms for other, unambiguous, terms) is just an invitation to confusion, especially if the IETF continues to have hair-splitting arguments about the nature of requirements in particular contexts.   Consequently, while the change proposed in erratum 419 (altering the definition phrase to reflect the language of Section 4) appears reasonable from an editorial standpoint, the correct fix is to remove the 2026 AS terms as acceptable synonyms from 2119 entirely.  If people want to say &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot; and give it specific meaning, they should say &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot; rather than trying to use nearly-synonymous terms and hoping that the reader will figure out what was really met.
