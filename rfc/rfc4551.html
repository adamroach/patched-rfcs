Abstract

   Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate changes to
   a common IMAP mailbox.  Examples include different clients working on
   behalf of the same user, and multiple users accessing shared
   mailboxes.  These clients need a mechanism to synchronize state
   changes for messages within the mailbox.  They must be able to
   guarantee that only one client can change message state (e.g.,
   message flags) at any time.  An example of such an application is use
   of an IMAP mailbox as a message queue with multiple dequeueing
   clients.

   The Conditional Store facility provides a protected update mechanism
   for message state information that can detect and resolve conflicts
   between multiple writing mail clients.

   The Conditional Store facility also allows a client to quickly
   resynchronize mailbox flag changes.

   This document defines an extension to IMAP (RFC 3501).

RFC 4551          IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE         June 2006


1. Introduction and Overview

   The Conditional STORE extension is present in any IMAP4
   implementation that returns &quot;CONDSTORE&quot; as one of the supported
   capabilities in the CAPABILITY command response.

   An IMAP server that supports this extension MUST associate a positive
   unsigned 64-bit value called a modification sequence (mod-sequence)
   with every IMAP message.  This is an opaque value updated by the
   server whenever a metadata item is modified.  The server MUST
   guarantee that each STORE command performed on the same mailbox
   (including simultaneous stores to different metadata items from
   different connections) will get a different mod-sequence value.
   Also, for any two successful STORE operations performed in the same
   session on the same mailbox, the mod-sequence of the second completed
   operation MUST be greater than the mod-sequence of the first
   completed.  Note that the latter rule disallows the use of the system
   clock as a mod-sequence, because if system time changes (e.g., an NTP
   [NTP] client adjusting the time), the next generated value might be
   less than the previous one.

   Mod-sequences allow a client that supports the CONDSTORE extension to
   determine if a message metadata has changed since some known moment.
   Whenever the state of a flag changes (i.e., the flag is added where
   previously it wasn&#39;t set, or the flag is removed and before it was
   set) the value of the modification sequence for the message MUST be
   updated.  Adding the flag when it is already present or removing when
   it is not present SHOULD NOT change the mod-sequence.

   When a message is appended to a mailbox (via the IMAP APPEND command,
   COPY to the mailbox, or using an external mechanism) the server
   generates a new modification sequence that is higher than the highest
   modification sequence of all messages in the mailbox and assigns it
   to the appended message.

   The server MAY store separate (per-message) modification sequence
   values for different metadata items.  If the server does so, per-
   message mod-sequence is the highest mod-sequence of all metadata
   items for the specified message.

   The server that supports this extension is not required to be able to
   store mod-sequences for every available mailbox.  Section 3.1.2
   describes how the server may act if a particular mailbox doesn&#39;t
   support the persistent storage of mod-sequences.

RFC 4551          IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE         June 2006


   This extension makes the following changes to the IMAP4 protocol:

      a) adds UNCHANGEDSINCE STORE modifier.

      b) adds the MODIFIED response code which should be used with an OK
         response to the STORE command.  (It can also be used in a NO
         response.)

      c) adds a new MODSEQ message data item for use with the FETCH
         command.

      d) adds CHANGEDSINCE FETCH modifier.

      e) adds a new MODSEQ search criterion.

      f) extends the syntax of untagged SEARCH responses to include
         mod-sequence.

      g) adds new OK untagged responses for the SELECT and EXAMINE
         commands.

      h) defines an additional parameter to SELECT/EXAMINE commands.

      i) adds the HIGHESTMODSEQ status data item to the STATUS command.

   A client supporting CONDSTORE extension indicates its willingness to
   receive mod-sequence updates in all untagged FETCH responses by
   issuing:

      -  a SELECT or EXAMINE command with the CONDSTORE parameter,
      -  a STATUS (HIGHESTMODSEQ) command,
      -  a FETCH or SEARCH command that includes the MODSEQ message data
         item,
      -  a FETCH command with the CHANGEDSINCE modifier, or
      -  a STORE command with the UNCHANGEDSINCE modifier.

   The server MUST include mod-sequence data in all subsequent untagged
   FETCH responses (until the connection is closed), whether they were
   caused by a regular STORE, a STORE with UNCHANGEDSINCE modifier, or
   an external agent.

   This document uses the term &quot;CONDSTORE-aware client&quot; to refer to a
   client that announces its willingness to receive mod-sequence updates
   as described above.  The term &quot;CONDSTORE enabling command&quot; will refer
   any of the commands listed above.  A future extension to this
   document may extend the list of CONDSTORE enabling commands.  A first
   CONDSTORE enabling command executed in the session MUST cause the

   server to return HIGHESTMODSEQ (Section 3.1.1) unless the server has
   sent NOMODSEQ (Section 3.1.2) response code when the currently
   selected mailbox was selected.

   The rest of this document describes the protocol changes more
   rigorously.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].

   In examples, lines beginning with &quot;S:&quot; are sent by the IMAP server,
   and lines beginning with &quot;C:&quot; are sent by the client.  Line breaks
   may appear in example commands solely for editorial clarity; when
   present in the actual message, they are represented by &quot;CRLF&quot;.

   Formal syntax is defined using ABNF [ABNF].

   The term &quot;metadata&quot; or &quot;metadata item&quot; is used throughout this
   document.  It refers to any system or user-defined keyword.  Future
   documents may extend &quot;metadata&quot; to include other dynamic message
   data.

   Some IMAP mailboxes are private, accessible only to the owning user.
   Other mailboxes are not, either because the owner has set an Access
   Control List [ACL] that permits access by other users, or because it
   is a shared mailbox.  Let&#39;s call a metadata item &quot;shared&quot; for the
   mailbox if any changes to the metadata items are persistent and
   visible to all other users accessing the mailbox.  Otherwise, the
   metadata item is called &quot;private&quot;.  Note that private metadata items
   are still visible to all sessions accessing the mailbox as the same
   user.  Also note that different mailboxes may have different metadata
   items as shared.

   See Section 1 for the definition of a &quot;CONDSTORE-aware client&quot; and a
   &quot;CONDSTORE enabling command&quot;.

3.  IMAP Protocol Changes

3.1.  New OK Untagged Responses for SELECT and EXAMINE

   This document adds two new response codes, HIGHESTMODSEQ and
   NOMODSEQ.  One of those response codes MUST be returned in the OK
   untagged response for a successful SELECT/EXAMINE command.

   When opening a mailbox, the server must check if the mailbox supports
   the persistent storage of mod-sequences.  If the mailbox supports the
   persistent storage of mod-sequences and the mailbox open operation
   succeeds, the server MUST send the OK untagged response including
   HIGHESTMODSEQ response code.  If the persistent storage for the
   mailbox is not supported, the server MUST send the OK untagged
   response including NOMODSEQ response code instead.

3.1.1.  HIGHESTMODSEQ Response Code

   This document adds a new response code that is returned in the OK
   untagged response for the SELECT and EXAMINE commands.  A server
   supporting the persistent storage of mod-sequences for the mailbox
   MUST send the OK untagged response including HIGHESTMODSEQ response
   code with every successful SELECT or EXAMINE command:

      OK [HIGHESTMODSEQ &lt;mod-sequence-value&gt;]

      where &lt;mod-sequence-value&gt; is the highest mod-sequence value of
      all messages in the mailbox.  When the server changes UIDVALIDITY
      for a mailbox, it doesn&#39;t have to keep the same HIGHESTMODSEQ for
      the mailbox.

   A disconnected client can use the value of HIGHESTMODSEQ to check if
   it has to refetch metadata from the server.  If the UIDVALIDITY value
   has changed for the selected mailbox, the client MUST delete the
   cached value of HIGHESTMODSEQ.  If UIDVALIDITY for the mailbox is the
   same, and if the HIGHESTMODSEQ value stored in the client&#39;s cache is
   less than the value returned by the server, then some metadata items
   on the server have changed since the last synchronization, and the
   client needs to update its cache.  The client MAY use SEARCH MODSEQ
   (Section 3.4) to find out exactly which metadata items have changed.
   Alternatively, the client MAY issue FETCH with the CHANGEDSINCE
   modifier (Section 3.3.1) in order to fetch data for all messages that
   have metadata items changed since some known modification sequence.

   Example 1:

      C: A142 SELECT INBOX
      S: * 172 EXISTS

      S: * 1 RECENT
      S: * OK [UNSEEN 12] Message 12 is first unseen
      S: * OK [UIDVALIDITY 3857529045] UIDs valid
      S: * OK [UIDNEXT 4392] Predicted next UID
      S: * FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft)
      S: * OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Deleted \Seen \*)] Limited
      S: * OK [HIGHESTMODSEQ 715194045007]
      S: A142 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed

3.1.2.  NOMODSEQ Response Code

   A server that doesn&#39;t support the persistent storage of mod-sequences
   for the mailbox MUST send the OK untagged response including NOMODSEQ
   response code with every successful SELECT or EXAMINE command.  A
   server that returned NOMODSEQ response code for a mailbox, which
   subsequently receives one of the following commands while the mailbox
   is selected:

      -  a FETCH command with the CHANGEDSINCE modifier,
      -  a FETCH or SEARCH command that includes the MODSEQ message data
         item, or
      -  a STORE command with the UNCHANGEDSINCE modifier

   MUST reject any such command with the tagged BAD response.

   Example 2:

      C: A142 SELECT INBOX
      S: * 172 EXISTS
      S: * 1 RECENT
      S: * OK [UNSEEN 12] Message 12 is first unseen
      S: * OK [UIDVALIDITY 3857529045] UIDs valid
      S: * OK [UIDNEXT 4392] Predicted next UID
      S: * FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft)
      S: * OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Deleted \Seen \*)] Limited
      S: * OK [NOMODSEQ] Sorry, this mailbox format doesn&#39;t support
           modsequences
      S: A142 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed

3.2.  STORE and UID STORE Commands

      S: * 50 FETCH (MODSEQ (12111230048))
      S: c101 OK Store (conditional) completed

</pre><i><b>Errata Notes: </b>

Since successful conditional stores MUST return the FETCH (MODSEQ) data for every message that was changed, the untagged FETCH response in this example should refer to the same message as the STORE command.  To avoid any suggestion that 1 might be a special case, I have made the correction to use 50 in both contexts.

   This document defines the following STORE modifier (see Section 2.5
   of [IMAPABNF]):

   UNCHANGEDSINCE &lt;mod-sequence&gt;

      For each message specified in the message set, the server performs
      the following.  If the mod-sequence of any metadata item of the

      message is equal or less than the specified UNCHANGEDSINCE value,
      then the requested operation (as described by the message data
      item) is performed.  If the operation is successful, the server
      MUST update the mod-sequence attribute of the message.  An
      untagged FETCH response MUST be sent, even if the .SILENT suffix
      is specified, and the response MUST include the MODSEQ message
      data item.  This is required to update the client&#39;s cache with the
      correct mod-sequence values.  See Section 3.3.2 for more details.
<font color='red'><s>

      However, if the mod-sequence of any metadata item of the message
      is greater than the specified UNCHANGEDSINCE value, then the
      requested operation MUST NOT be performed.  In this case, the
      mod-sequence attribute of the message is not updated, and the
      message number (or unique identifier in the case of the UID STORE
      command) is added to the list of messages that failed the
      UNCHANGESINCE test.

      When the server finished performing the operation on all the
      messages in the message set, it checks for a non-empty list of
      messages that failed the UNCHANGESINCE test.  If this list is
      non-empty, the server MUST return in the tagged response a
      MODIFIED response code.  The MODIFIED response code includes the
      message set (for STORE) or set of UIDs (for UID STORE) of all
      messages that failed the UNCHANGESINCE test.

   Example 3:

      All messages pass the UNCHANGESINCE test.

      C: a103 UID STORE 6,4,8 (UNCHANGEDSINCE 12121230045)
          +FLAGS.SILENT (\Deleted)

      S: * 2 FETCH (UID 6 MODSEQ (12121230852))

      However, if the mod-sequence of any metadata item of the message

      S: * 50 FETCH (MODSEQ (12111230048))
      S: c101 OK Store (conditional) completed

      HIGHESTMODSEQ response code was sent by the server presumably
      because this was the first CONDSTORE enabling command.

   Example 6:

      In spite of the failure of the conditional STORE operation for
      message 7, the server continues to process the conditional STORE
      in order to find all messages that fail the test.

      C: d105 STORE 7,5,9 (UNCHANGEDSINCE 320162338)
          +FLAGS.SILENT (\Deleted)
      S: * 5 FETCH (MODSEQ (320162350))
      S: d105 OK [MODIFIED 7,9] Conditional STORE failed

   Example 7:

      Same as above, but the server follows the SHOULD recommendation in
      Section 6.4.6 of [IMAP4].

      C: d105 STORE 7,5,9 (UNCHANGEDSINCE 320162338)
          +FLAGS.SILENT (\Deleted)
      S: * 7 FETCH (MODSEQ (320162342) FLAGS (\Seen \Deleted))
      S: * 5 FETCH (MODSEQ (320162350))
      S: * 9 FETCH (MODSEQ (320162349) FLAGS (\Answered))
      S: d105 OK [MODIFIED 7,9] Conditional STORE failed

      Use of UNCHANGEDSINCE with a modification sequence of 0 always
      fails if the metadata item exists.  A system flag MUST always be
      considered existent, whether it was set or not.

   Example 8:

      C: a102 STORE 12 (UNCHANGEDSINCE 0)
          +FLAGS.SILENT ($MDNSent)
      S: a102 OK [MODIFIED 12] Conditional STORE failed

      The client has tested the presence of the $MDNSent user-defined
      keyword.

   Note: A client trying to make an atomic change to the state of a
   particular metadata item (or a set of metadata items) should be
   prepared to deal with the case when the server returns the MODIFIED
   response code if the state of the metadata item being watched hasn&#39;t
   changed (but the state of some other metadata item has).  This is
   necessary, because some servers don&#39;t store separate mod-sequences



Melnikov &amp; Hole             Standards Track                     [Page 9]

RFC 4551          IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE         June 2006


   for different metadata items.  However, a server implementation
   SHOULD avoid generating spurious MODIFIED responses for +FLAGS/-FLAGS
   STORE operations, even when the server stores a single mod-sequence
   per message.  Section 5 describes how this can be achieved.

   Unless the server has included an unsolicited FETCH to update
   client&#39;s knowledge about messages that have failed the UNCHANGEDSINCE
   test, upon receipt of the MODIFIED response code, the client SHOULD
   try to figure out if the required metadata items have indeed changed
   by issuing FETCH or NOOP command.  It is RECOMMENDED that the server
   avoids the need for the client to do that by sending an unsolicited
   FETCH response (Examples 9 and 10).

   If the required metadata items haven&#39;t changed, the client SHOULD
   retry the command with the new mod-sequence.  The client SHOULD allow
   for a configurable but reasonable number of retries (at least 2).

   Example 9:

      In the example below, the server returns the MODIFIED response
      code without sending information describing why the STORE
      UNCHANGEDSINCE operation has failed.

      S: a106 OK Conditional STORE completed

   Example 11:

      The following example is based on the example from the Section
      4.2.3 of [RFC-2180] and demonstrates that the MODIFIED response
      code may be also returned in the tagged NO response.

      Client tries to conditionally STORE flags on a mixture of expunged
      and non-expunged messages; one message fails the UNCHANGEDSINCE
      test.

      C: B001 STORE 1:7 (UNCHANGEDSINCE 320172338) +FLAGS (\SEEN)
      S: * 1 FETCH (MODSEQ (320172342) FLAGS (\SEEN))
      S: * 3 FETCH (MODSEQ (320172342) FLAGS (\SEEN))
      S: B001 NO [MODIFIED 2] Some of the messages no longer exist.

      C: B002 NOOP
      S: * 4 EXPUNGE
      S: * 4 EXPUNGE
      S: * 4 EXPUNGE
      S: * 4 EXPUNGE
      S: * 2 FETCH (MODSEQ (320172340) FLAGS (\Deleted \Answered))
      S: B002 OK NOOP Completed.

      By receiving FETCH responses for messages 1 and 3, and EXPUNGE
      responses that indicate that messages 4 through 7 have been
      expunged, the client retries the operation only for the message 2.
      The updated UNCHANGEDSINCE value is used.

      C: b003 STORE 2 (UNCHANGEDSINCE 320172340) +FLAGS (\Seen)
      S: * 2 FETCH (MODSEQ (320180050))
      S: b003 OK Conditional Store completed

   Note: If a message is specified multiple times in the message set,
   and the server doesn&#39;t internally eliminate duplicates from the
   message set, it MUST NOT fail the conditional STORE operation for the
   second (or subsequent) occurrence of the message if the operation
   completed successfully for the first occurrence.  For example, if the
   client specifies:

RFC 4551          IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE         June 2006


         e105 STORE 7,3:9 (UNCHANGEDSINCE 12121230045)
          +FLAGS.SILENT (\Deleted)

   the server must not fail the operation for message 7 as part of
   processing &quot;3:9&quot; if it succeeded when message 7 was processed the
   first time.

   Once the client specified the UNCHANGEDSINCE modifier in a STORE
   command, the server MUST include the MODSEQ fetch response data items
   in all subsequent unsolicited FETCH responses.

   This document also changes the behaviour of the server when it has
   performed a STORE or UID STORE command and the UNCHANGEDSINCE
   modifier is not specified.  If the operation is successful for a
   message, the server MUST update the mod-sequence attribute of the
   message.  The server is REQUIRED to include the mod-sequence value
   whenever it decides to send the unsolicited FETCH response to all
   CONDSTORE-aware clients that have opened the mailbox containing the
   message.

   Server implementers should also see Section 3.8 for additional
   quality of implementation issues related to the STORE command.

3.3.  FETCH and UID FETCH Commands

3.3.1.  CHANGEDSINCE FETCH Modifier

   This document defines the following FETCH modifier (see Section 2.4
   of [IMAPABNF]):

   CHANGEDSINCE &lt;mod-sequence&gt;

      CHANGEDSINCE FETCH modifier allows to create a further subset of
      the list of messages described by sequence set.  The information
      described by message data items is only returned for messages that
      have mod-sequence bigger than &lt;mod-sequence&gt;.

      When CHANGEDSINCE FETCH modifier is specified, it implicitly adds
      MODSEQ FETCH message data item (Section 3.3.2).

   Example 12:

      C: s100 UID FETCH 1:* (FLAGS) (CHANGEDSINCE 12345)
      S: * 1 FETCH (UID 4 MODSEQ (65402) FLAGS (\Seen))
      S: * 2 FETCH (UID 6 MODSEQ (75403) FLAGS (\Deleted))
      S: * 4 FETCH (UID 8 MODSEQ (29738) FLAGS ($NoJunk $AutoJunk
           $MDNSent))
      S: s100 OK FETCH completed

3.3.2.  MODSEQ Message Data Item in FETCH Command

   This extension adds a MODSEQ message data item to the FETCH command.
   The MODSEQ message data item allows clients to retrieve mod-sequence
   values for a range of messages in the currently selected mailbox.

   Once the client specified the MODSEQ message data item in a FETCH
   request, the server MUST include the MODSEQ fetch response data items
   in all subsequent unsolicited FETCH responses.

   Syntax:  MODSEQ

      The MODSEQ message data item causes the server to return MODSEQ
      fetch response data items.

   Syntax:  MODSEQ ( &lt;permsg-modsequence&gt; )

      MODSEQ response data items contain per-message mod-sequences.

      The MODSEQ response data item is returned if the client issued
      FETCH with MODSEQ message data item.  It also allows the server to
      notify the client about mod-sequence changes caused by conditional
      STOREs (Section 3.2) and/or changes caused by external sources.

   Example 13:

      C: a FETCH 1:3 (MODSEQ)
      S: * 1 FETCH (MODSEQ (624140003))
      S: * 2 FETCH (MODSEQ (624140007))
      S: * 3 FETCH (MODSEQ (624140005))
      S: a OK Fetch complete

      In this example, the client requests per-message mod-sequences for
      a set of messages.

   When a flag for a message is modified in a different session, the
   server sends an unsolicited FETCH response containing the mod-
   sequence for the message.

   Example 14:

      (Session 1, authenticated as a user &quot;alex&quot;).  The user adds a
      shared flag \Deleted:

         C: A142 SELECT INBOX
         ...
         S: * FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft)
         S: * OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Answered \Deleted \Seen \*)] Limited

         ...

         C: A160 STORE 7 +FLAGS.SILENT (\Deleted)
         S: * 7 FETCH (MODSEQ (2121231000))
         S: A160 OK Store completed

      (Session 2, also authenticated as the user &quot;alex&quot;).  Any changes
      to flags are always reported to all sessions authenticated as the
      same user as in the session 1.

         C: C180 NOOP
         S: * 7 FETCH (FLAGS (\Deleted \Answered) MODSEQ (12121231000))
         S: C180 OK Noop completed

      (Session 3, authenticated as a user &quot;andrew&quot;).  As \Deleted is a
      shared flag, changes in session 1 are also reported in session 3:

         C: D210 NOOP
         S: * 7 FETCH (FLAGS (\Deleted \Answered) MODSEQ (12121231000))
         S: D210 OK Noop completed

      The user modifies a private flag \Seen in session 1...

         C: A240 STORE 7 +FLAGS.SILENT (\Seen)
         S: * 7 FETCH (MODSEQ (12121231777))
         S: A240 OK Store completed

      ...which is only reported in session 2...

         C: C270 NOOP
         S: * 7 FETCH (FLAGS (\Deleted \Answered \Seen) MODSEQ
              (12121231777))
         S: C270 OK Noop completed

      ...but not in session 3.

         C: D300 NOOP
         S: D300 OK Noop completed

      And finally, the user removes flags \Answered (shared) and \Seen
      (private) in session 1.

         C: A330 STORE 7 -FLAGS.SILENT (\Answered \Seen)
         S: * 7 FETCH (MODSEQ (12121245160))
         S: A330 OK Store completed

      Both changes are reported in the session 2...

         C: C360 NOOP
         S: * 7 FETCH (FLAGS (\Deleted) MODSEQ (12121245160))
         S: C360 OK Noop completed

      ...and only changes to shared flags are reported in session 3.

         C: D390 NOOP
         S: * 7 FETCH (FLAGS (\Deleted) MODSEQ (12121245160))
         S: D390 OK Noop completed

   Server implementers should also see Section 3.8 for additional
   quality of implementation issues related to the FETCH command.

3.4.  MODSEQ Search Criterion in SEARCH

   The MODSEQ criterion for the SEARCH command allows a client to search
   for the metadata items that were modified since a specified moment.

   Syntax:  MODSEQ [&lt;entry-name&gt; &lt;entry-type-req&gt;] &lt;mod-sequence-valzer&gt;

      Messages that have modification values that are equal to or
      greater than &lt;mod-sequence-valzer&gt;.  This allows a client, for
      example, to find out which messages contain metadata items that
      have changed since the last time it updated its disconnected
      cache.  The client may also specify &lt;entry-name&gt; (name of metadata
      item) and &lt;entry-type-req&gt; (type of metadata item) before
      &lt;mod-sequence-valzer&gt;.  &lt;entry-type-req&gt; can be one of &quot;shared&quot;,
      &quot;priv&quot; (private), or &quot;all&quot;.  The latter means that the server
      should use the biggest value among &quot;priv&quot; and &quot;shared&quot; mod-
      sequences for the metadata item.  If the server doesn&#39;t store
      internally separate mod-sequences for different metadata items, it
      MUST ignore &lt;entry-name&gt; and &lt;entry-type-req&gt;.  Otherwise, the
      server should use them to narrow down the search.

      For a flag &lt;flagname&gt;, the corresponding &lt;entry-name&gt; has a form
      &quot;/flags/&lt;flagname&gt;&quot; as defined in [IMAPABNF].  Note that the
      leading &quot;\&quot; character that denotes a system flag has to be escaped
      as per Section 4.3 of [IMAP4], as the &lt;entry-name&gt; uses syntax for
      quoted strings.

   If client specifies a MODSEQ criterion in a SEARCH command and the
   server returns a non-empty SEARCH result, the server MUST also append
   (to the end of the untagged SEARCH response) the highest mod-sequence
   for all messages being returned.  See also Section 3.5.

RFC 4551          IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE         June 2006


   Example 15:

      C: a SEARCH MODSEQ &quot;/flags/\\draft&quot; all 620162338
      S: * SEARCH 2 5 6 7 11 12 18 19 20 23 (MODSEQ 917162500)
      S: a OK Search complete

      In the above example, the message numbers of any messages
      containing the string &quot;IMAP4&quot; in the &quot;value&quot; attribute of the
      &quot;/comment&quot; entry and having a mod-sequence equal to or greater
      than 620162338 for the &quot;\Draft&quot; flag are returned in the search
      results.

   Example 16:

      C: t SEARCH OR NOT MODSEQ 720162338 LARGER 50000
      S: * SEARCH
      S: t OK Search complete, nothing found

3.5.  Modified SEARCH Untagged Response

   Data:       zero or more numbers
               mod-sequence value (omitted if no match)

   This document extends syntax of the untagged SEARCH response to
   include the highest mod-sequence for all messages being returned.

   If a client specifies a MODSEQ criterion in a SEARCH (or UID SEARCH)
   command and the server returns a non-empty SEARCH result, the server
   MUST also append (to the end of the untagged SEARCH response) the
   highest mod-sequence for all messages being returned.  See Section
   3.4 for examples.

3.6.  HIGHESTMODSEQ Status Data Items

   This document defines a new status data item:

   HIGHESTMODSEQ

      The highest mod-sequence value of all messages in the mailbox.
      This is the same value that is returned by the server in the
      HIGHESTMODSEQ response code in an OK untagged response (see
      Section 3.1.1).  If the server doesn&#39;t support the persistent
      storage of mod-sequences for the mailbox (see Section 3.1.2), the
      server MUST return 0 as the value of HIGHESTMODSEQ status data
      item.

RFC 4551          IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE         June 2006


   Example 17:

      C: A042 STATUS blurdybloop (UIDNEXT MESSAGES HIGHESTMODSEQ)
      S: * STATUS blurdybloop (MESSAGES 231 UIDNEXT 44292
           HIGHESTMODSEQ 7011231777)
      S: A042 OK STATUS completed

3.7.  CONDSTORE Parameter to SELECT and EXAMINE

   The CONDSTORE extension defines a single optional select parameter,
   &quot;CONDSTORE&quot;, which tells the server that it MUST include the MODSEQ
   fetch response data items in all subsequent unsolicited FETCH
   responses.

   The CONDSTORE parameter to SELECT/EXAMINE helps avoid a race
   condition that might arise when one or more metadata items are
   modified in another session after the server has sent the
   HIGHESTMODSEQ response code and before the client was able to issue a
   CONDSTORE enabling command.

   Example 18:

      C: A142 SELECT INBOX (CONDSTORE)
      S: * 172 EXISTS
      S: * 1 RECENT
      S: * OK [UNSEEN 12] Message 12 is first unseen
      S: * OK [UIDVALIDITY 3857529045] UIDs valid
      S: * OK [UIDNEXT 4392] Predicted next UID
      S: * FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft)
      S: * OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Deleted \Seen \*)] Limited
      S: * OK [HIGHESTMODSEQ 715194045007]
      S: A142 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed, CONDSTORE is now enabled

3.8.  Additional Quality-of-Implementation Issues

   Server implementations should follow the following rule, which
   applies to any successfully completed STORE/UID STORE (with and
   without UNCHANGEDSINCE modifier), as well as to a FETCH command that
   implicitly sets \Seen flag:

      Adding the flag when it is already present or removing when it is
      not present SHOULD NOT change the mod-sequence.

   This will prevent spurious client synchronization requests.

RFC 4551          IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE         June 2006


   However, note that client implementers MUST NOT rely on this server
   behavior.  A client can&#39;t distinguish between the case when a server
   has violated the SHOULD mentioned above, and that when one or more
   clients set and unset (or unset and set) the flag in another session.

4.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) [ABNF] notation.  Elements not defined here can be found
   in the formal syntax of the ABNF [ABNF], IMAP [IMAP4], and IMAP ABNF
   extensions [IMAPABNF] specifications.

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.  The use of upper- or lowercase characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

5.  Server Implementation Considerations

   This section describes how a server implementation that doesn&#39;t store
   separate per-metadata mod-sequences for different metadata items can
   avoid sending the MODIFIED response to any of the following
   conditional STORE operations:

      +FLAGS
      -FLAGS
      +FLAGS.SILENT
      -FLAGS.SILENT

   Note that the optimization described in this section can&#39;t be
   performed in case of a conditional STORE FLAGS operation.

   Let&#39;s use the following example.  The client has issued

      C: a106 STORE 100:150 (UNCHANGEDSINCE 212030000000)
         +FLAGS.SILENT ($Processed)

   When the server receives the command and parses it successfully, it
   iterates through the message set and tries to execute the conditional
   STORE command for each message.

RFC 4551          IMAP Extension for Conditional STORE         June 2006


   Each server internally works as a client, i.e., it has to cache the
   current state of all IMAP flags as it is known to the client.  In
   order to report flag changes to the client, the server compares the
   cached values with the values in its database for IMAP flags.

   Imagine that another client has changed the state of a flag \Deleted
   on the message 101 and that the change updated the mod-sequence for
   the message.  The server knows that the mod-sequence for the mailbox
   has changed; however, it also knows that:

   a) the client is not interested in \Deleted flag, as it hasn&#39;t
      included it in +FLAGS.SILENT operation; and

   b) the state of the flag $Processed hasn&#39;t changed (the server can
      determine this by comparing cached flag state with the state of
      the flag in the database).

   Therefore, the server doesn&#39;t have to report MODIFIED to the client.
   Instead, the server may set $Processed flag, update the mod-sequence
   for the message 101 once again and send an untagged FETCH response
   with new mod-sequence and flags:

      S: * 101 FETCH (MODSEQ (303011130956)
         FLAGS ($Processed \Deleted \Answered))

   See also Section 3.8 for additional quality-of-implementation issues.

6.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that the Conditional STORE extension doesn&#39;t raise any
   new security concerns that are not already discussed in [IMAP4].
   However, the availability of this extension may make it possible for
   IMAP4 to be used in critical applications it could not be used for
   previously, making correct IMAP server implementation and operation
   even more important.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a standards track or
   IESG approved experimental RFC.  The registry is currently located
   at:

         http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities

   This document defines the CONDSTORE IMAP capability.  IANA has added
   it to the registry accordingly.
