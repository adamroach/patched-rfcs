RFC 4439        Fibre Channel Fabric Address Manager MIB      March 2006


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related
   to a Fibre Channel network&#39;s Fabric Address Manager.  Fabric Address
   Manager refers to the functionality of acquiring DomainID(s) as
   specified in [FC-SW-3], and managing Fibre Channel Identifiers as
   specified in [FC-FS].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel

   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point
   serial data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre Channel
   provides a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols such
   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-
   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet
   Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.

   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple
   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a
   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A
   Fibre Channel &quot;node&quot; consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may
   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are
   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch
   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single
   port on a switch via an &quot;Arbitrated Loop&quot; topology, the switch port
   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes&#39; ports are called NL_Ports.  The
   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The
   term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A
   switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an

RFC 4439        Fibre Channel Fabric Address Manager MIB      March 2006


   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a
   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset
   of E_Port functionality.

   Many Fibre Channel components, including the Fabric, each node, and
   most ports, have globally-unique names.  These globally-unique names
   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information
   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].  WWNs are expected to be persistent
   across agent and unit resets.

   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers, which
   identify the frame&#39;s source and destination ports.  Each FC port has
   both an address identifier and a WWN.  When a Fabric is in use, the
   FC address identifiers are dynamically assigned by a switch.  Each
   octet of a 24-bit address represents a level in an address hierarchy,
   with a Domain_ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.

   Each switch in a Fabric is assigned one (or more) unique Domain_IDs
   using a two-step process.  First, one switch, called Principal
   Switch, is selected from the switches of a Fabric.  Then, the
   Principal Switch assigns Domain_IDs to the other switches of the
   Fabric.  Address assignment within a domain is performed by the
   switch to which that Domain_ID is granted.

4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel [RFC2837] was focused on
   Fibre Channel switches.  It is being replaced by the more generic
   Fibre Channel Management MIB [FC-MGMT], which defines basic
   information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including
   extensions to the standard IF-MIB [IF-MIB] for Fibre Channel
   interfaces.  [FC-MGMT] includes the specification of how the generic
   objects defined in [IF-MIB] apply to Fibre Channel interfaces.

   Note that an interface&#39;s ifIndex value must be unique within an SNMP
   context, irrespective of how many Fibre Channel management instances
   (see below) and how many Fibre Channel switches are instrumented
   within that SNMP context.

   This document defines the T11-FC-FABRIC-ADDR-MGR-MIB module, which
   extends beyond [FC-MGMT] to cover the functionality, in Fibre Channel
   switches, which is used to manage Fabric configuration, domains, and
   addresses within a domain.

   This document also contains a MIB module, T11-TC-MIB, to define
   textual conventions that might also be useful in other MIBs defined
   by T11.

5.  MIB Overview

   This section explains the use of a Fibre Channel management instance,
   a Switch Index, and a Fabric Index.  It also describes the six MIB
   groups contained in the MIB.

5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance

   A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [FC-MGMT] as a
   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.  Fibre
   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management
   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the
   implementation(s).  For example, one such grouping accommodates a
   single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX sub-agents, with each sub-
   agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management instance.

   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB
   [FC-MGMT] as the index value to uniquely identify a Fibre Channel
   management instance.

5.2.  Switch Index

   The FC-MGMT-MIB [FC-MGMT] defines the fcmSwitchTable as a table of
   information about Fibre Channel switches that are managed by Fibre
   Channel management instances.  Each Fibre Channel management instance
   can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.  The Switch Index,
   fcmSwitchIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB as the index value
   to uniquely identify a Fibre Channel switch amongst those (one or
   more) managed by the same Fibre Channel management instance.

5.3.  Fabric Index

   The [FC-SW-3] standard for an interconnecting Fabric consisting of
   multiple Fabric Switch elements describes the operation of a single
   Fabric in a physical infrastructure.  The current [FC-SW-4] standard
   also supports the operation of multiple Virtual Fabrics operating
   within one (or more) physical infrastructures.  In such a scenario,
   each Fabric has, of course, its own management instrumentation.  In
   order to accommodate this scenario, this MIB module defines all
   Fabric-related information in tables that are INDEXed by an arbitrary
   integer, named a &quot;Fabric Index&quot;.  In a Fabric that is conformant to
   [FC-SW-3], the value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.









DeSanti, et al.             Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 4439        Fibre Channel Fabric Address Manager MIB      March 2006


   It is quite possible, and may even become likely, that (a port of) a
   Fibre Channel switch will be connected to multiple such Fabrics.
   Thus, in order to simplify a query concerning all the Fabrics to
   which a single switch is connected, fcmSwitchIndex will be listed
   before t11FamFabricIndex when they both appear in the same INDEX
   clause.

5.4.  The t11FamGroup Group

   This group contains basic information about the Fabric Address
   Manager functionality within a switch, including its configuration
   parameters that are per-interface (i.e., specified for a particular
   Fibre Channel interface identified by an ifIndex value).

5.5.  The t11FamDatabaseGroup Group

   This group contains information about which switches are assigned to
   which domains.

5.6.  The t11FamAreaGroup Group

   This group contains information about which Port-IDs have been
   assigned within the areas of the local domain.

5.7.  The t11FamCacheGroup Group

   This conditional mandatory group contains information about all the
   FC address identifier assignments that have been recently released.
   This cache is kept to support the concept of Preferred Domain_ID via
   a best-effort attempt for (short-term) re-assignment of the same FC
   address identifiers.

5.8.  The t11FamCommandGroup Group

   This optional group contains objects used for initiating an operation
   on a Fabric.

5.9.  The t11FamNotificationGroup Group

   This group contains notifications of significant events concerning
   the Fabric Address management functionality within a switch.

5.10.  Use of RCF and BF

   Included in [FC-SW-3] is the specification of Reconfigure Fabric
   (RCF) and Build Fabric (BF), both of which are command codes of the
   Switch Fabric Internal Link Service (SW_ILS).  [FC-SW-3] includes the
   warning:



DeSanti, et al.             Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 4439        Fibre Channel Fabric Address Manager MIB      March 2006


      NOTE 13 - Since the RCF causes a complete reconfiguration of the
      Fabric, and may cause addresses allocated to a Switch to change,
      this SW_ILS should be used with caution.  The BF SW_ILS allows the
      Fabric to attempt reconfiguration without loss of or change of
      address and therefore should be attempted before an RCF.  Examples
      of situations in which RCF may be appropriate include resolution
      of overlapped Domains, or the failure of a Fabric Reconfiguration
      initiated by a BF.

   Further, [FC-MI] specifies:

      A Fabric is prohibited from autonomously generating an RCF, but an
      outside administrative function may request a switch to generate
      an RCF.  Such an administrative function is outside the scope of
      this technical report.

   The T11-FC-FABRIC-ADDR-MGR-MIB defined in this document is consistent
   with both of the above quotes since it defines two objects,
   t11FamAutoReconfigure and t11FamRestart, which are defined with a
   MAX-ACCESS of read-write, and setting them to the appropriate value
   is a means by which &quot;an outside administrative function may request a
   switch to generate an RCF&quot; [FC-MI].

   Note, however, the MIB specifies in its compliance section that the
   minimum required level of support for these two objects is read-only.

   Further, for both t11FamAutoReconfigure and t11FamRestart, the MIB
   serves only as a request to generate; it does not represent the
   action of the RCF or BF.  That is, a successful SNMP SetRequest on
   these objects will cause an RCF (or BF) to be sent, but SNMP does
   not/cannot ensure the successful operation of the SW_ILS operation.

           there is always exactly one Fabric in a single physical
           infrastructure, the value of this Fabric Index will
           always be 1.

           However, the current standard, FC-SW-4, defines
           how multiple Fabrics, each with its own management
           instrumentation, could operate within one (or more)
           physical infrastructures.  When such multiple Fabrics
           are in use, this index value is used to uniquely
           identify a particular Fabric within a physical
           infrastructure.

           Note that the value of this textual convention has a
           range of (0..4095) so as to be consistent with FC-SW-4,
           which says that a &#39;VF_ID Bitmap&#39; is 512 bytes long, with
           the high-order bit representing VF_ID zero, and the
           low-order bit representing 4095.&quot;

           &quot;The MIB module for the Fabric Address management
           functionality defined by the Fibre Channel standards.  For
           the purposes of this MIB, Fabric Address Manager refers to

           After an agent reboot, the values of read-write objects
           defined in this MIB module are implementation-dependent.

    DESCRIPTION
           &quot;A unique index value that uniquely identifies a
           particular Fabric known to a particular switch.

           In a Fabric conformant to FC-SW-3, only a single Fabric
           can operate within a physical infrastructure, and thus,
           the value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.

           However, the current standard, FC-SW-4, defines
           how multiple Fabrics, each with its own management
           instrumentation, could operate within one (or more)
           physical infrastructures.  When such multiple Fabrics
           are in use, this index value is used to uniquely
           identify a particular Fabric within a physical
           infrastructure.&quot;

t11FamConfigDomainId OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      FcDomainIdOrZero
    MAX-ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
           &quot;The configured Domain_ID of the particular switch on this
           Fabric, or zero if no Domain_ID has been configured.
           The meaning of this object depends on
           t11FamConfigDomainIdType object.

           If t11FamConfigDomainIdType is &#39;preferred&#39;, then the
           configured Domain_ID is called the &#39;preferred Domain_ID&#39;.
           Valid values are between 0 and 239.  In a situation where
           this Domain_ID cannot be assigned, any other Domain_ID
           will be acceptable.  A value of zero means any Domain_ID.

           If t11FamConfigDomainIdType is &#39;insistent&#39;, then the
           configured Domain_ID is called the &#39;insistent Domain_ID&#39; and
           valid values are between 1 and 239.  In a situation where
           this Domain_ID cannot be assigned, no other Domain_ID is
           acceptable.

           In both of the above cases, the switch sends an RDI (Request
           Domain_ID) to request this Domain_ID to the Principal
           Switch.  If no Domain_ID is able to be granted in the case
           of &#39;preferred&#39;, or if an &#39;insistent&#39; Domain_ID is configured
           but not able to be granted, then it is an error condition.
           When this error occurs, the switch will continue as if it
           receives a SW_RJT with a reason/explanation of &#39;Unable to
           perform command request&#39;/&#39;Domain_ID not available&#39;.  That
           is, its E_Ports on that Fabric will be isolated and the
           administrator informed via a &#39;t11FamDomainIdNotAssigned&#39;
           notification.

           If t11FamConfigDomainIdType is &#39;static&#39;, then the configured
           Domain_ID is called the &#39;static Domain_ID&#39; and valid values
           are between 1 and 239.  In this situation, there is no
           Principal Switch in the Fabric and the Domain_ID is simply
           assigned by configuration, together with the Fabric_Name.
           A switch configured with a static Domain_ID, on receiving
           an EFP, BF, RCF, DIA, or RDI SW_ILS, shall reply with an
           SW_RJT having Reason Code Explanation &#39;E_Port is Isolated&#39;
           and shall isolate the receiving E_Port.

           The condition that might cause these errors is
           the merging of two disjoint Fabrics that have
           overlapping Domain_ID lists.

           If value of this object is &#39;true&#39;, the switch will
           send an RCF (ReConfigureFabric) to rebuild the
           Fabric.

           If &#39;false&#39;, the switch will isolate the E_Ports on

    DESCRIPTION
           &quot;Determines how a particular switch behaves when elected as
           the Principal Switch.

           If true, the switch will only accept RDIs with a contiguous
           allocation; specifically, it will reject RDIs with
           non-contiguous Domain_IDs, and if an RDI for a contiguous
           Domain_ID is not able to be fulfilled, it will try to
           replace all the Domain_IDs in the list with contiguous
           Domain_IDs, and if that fails, the RDI will be rejected.

           If false, then the switch acts normally in granting
           the Domain_IDs even if they are not contiguous.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has made two MIB OID assignments, one for the T11-TC-MIB module
   and one for the T11-FC-FABRIC-ADDR-MGR-MIB module, under the
   appropriate subtree(s).

11.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

         t11FamConfigDomainId, t11FamConfigDomainIdType and
         t11FamContiguousAllocation -- ability to change the address
         allocation policy.

         t11FamRestart and t11FamAutoReconfigure -- ability to cause a
         fabric reconfiguration, e.g., on certain error conditions.

         t11FamPriority -- ability to affect which switch becomes the
         Principal Switch.

         t11FamRcFabricNotifyEnable -- ability to enable/disable a
         notification.

         t11FamIfRcfReject -- ability to change the switch&#39;s behavior on
         receipt of an RCF.

         t11FamIfRowStatus -- ability to change an interface
         configuration parameter.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may also be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and
   their sensitivity/vulnerability:

         t11FamTable and t11FamIfTable -- contain the configuration,
         status, and statistics of the Fabric Address Manager.

RFC 4439        Fibre Channel Fabric Address Manager MIB      March 2006


         t11FamAreaTable, t11FamDatabaseTable and t11FamFcIdCacheTable
         -- contain information on currently assigned or recently-
         released addresses.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

The DESCRIPTION clause for the
t11FamAutoReconfigure OBJECT-TYPE macro invocation says:

           If value of this object is 'true', the switch will
           send an RCF (ReConfigureFabric) to rebuild the
           Fabric.

It should say:

           If the value of this object is 'true', the switch will
           send an RCF (ReConfigureFabric) to rebuild the
           Fabric.
