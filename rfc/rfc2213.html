      Integrated Services Management Information Base using SMIv2


Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the &quot;Internet
   Official Protocol Standards&quot; (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing the the interface
   attributes defined in the Integrated Services Model.  Comments should
   be made to the Integrated Services Working Group, int-serv@isi.edu.

RFC 2213          Integrated Services MIB using SMIv2     September 1997


1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

   o    RFC 1441 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
        describing and naming objects for the purpose of
        management.

   o    STD 17, RFC 1213 defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
        objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

   o    RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other
        architectural aspects of the framework.

   o    RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network
        access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

1.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

2.  Overview

2.1.  Textual Conventions

   Several new data types are introduced as a textual convention in this
   MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the readability of
   the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications
   if appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of the
   these textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the
   semantics of any managed objects.  The use of these is merely an

   artifact of the explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of
   one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP
   are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are
   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit
   of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

2.2.  Structure of MIB

   The MIB is composed of the following sections:
        Integrated Services
             Interface Attributes Table
             Interface Flow Table

        DESCRIPTION
           &quot;The Session  Number  convention  is  used  for
           numbers  identifying  sessions or saved PATH or
           RESV information. It is a number in  the  range
           returned  by  a TestAndIncr variable, having no
           protocol meaning whatsoever but serving instead
           as simple identifier.

           The alternative was a very complex instance  or

        DESCRIPTION
           &quot;The value of the IP Protocol field  of  an  IP
           Datagram  Header.  This identifies the protocol
           layer above IP.  For example, the  value  6  is
           used  for TCP and the value 17 is used for UDP.
           The values of this field are defined in the As-
           signed Numbers RFC.&quot;
       SYNTAX   INTEGER (1..255)

        DESCRIPTION
           &quot;The value of the C-Type field of a Session ob-
           ject,  as  defined  in  the RSVP specification.
           This value  determines  the  lengths  of  octet
           strings  and use of certain objects such as the

        DESCRIPTION
           &quot;The value of the UDP or TCP Source or Destina-
           tion  Port field, a virtual destination port or
           generalized port identifier used with the IPSEC
           Authentication Header or Encapsulating Security
           Payload, or other session discriminator.  If it
           is  not  used, the value should be of length 0.
           This pair, when coupled with the  IP  Addresses
           of the source and destination system and the IP
           protocol  field,  uniquely  identifies  a  data
           stream.&quot;

           in  the context.  Applicable contexts minimally
           include the speed of an  interface  or  virtual

4.  Security Considerations

   The use of an SNMP SET results in an RSVP or Integrated Services
   reservation under rules that are different compared to if the
   reservation was negotiated using RSVP. However, no other security
   considerations exist other than those imposed by SNMP itself.
