1.  Introduction and Terminology

   This document defines a &quot;Bit-String Label&quot; which may appear within
   domain names.  This new label type compactly represents a sequence of
   &quot;One-Bit Labels&quot; and enables resource records to be stored at any
   bit-boundary in a binary-named section of the domain name tree.

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KWORD].

2.  Motivation

   Binary labels are intended to efficiently solve the problem of
   storing data and delegating authority on arbitrary boundaries when
   the structure of underlying name space is most naturally represented
   in binary.

3.  Label Format

   Up to 256 One-Bit Labels can be grouped into a single Bit-String
   Label.  Within a Bit-String Label the most significant or &quot;highest
   level&quot; bit appears first.  This is unlike the ordering of DNS labels
   themselves, which has the least significant or &quot;lowest level&quot; label
   first.  Nonetheless, this ordering seems to be the most natural and
   efficient for representing binary labels.

RFC 2673        Binary Labels in the Domain Name System      August 1999


   Among consecutive Bit-String Labels, the bits in the first-appearing
   label are less significant or &quot;at a lower level&quot; than the bits in
   subsequent Bit-String Labels, just as ASCII labels are ordered.

3.1.  Encoding

      0                   1                   2
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2     . . .
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-//+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |0 1|    ELT    |     Count     |           Label ...         |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+//-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   (Each tic mark represents one bit.)


   ELT       000001 binary, the six-bit extended label type [EDNS0]
             assigned to the Bit-String Label.

   Count     The number of significant bits in the Label field.  A Count
             value of zero indicates that 256 bits are significant.
             (Thus the null label representing the DNS root cannot be
             represented as a Bit String Label.)

   Label     The bit string representing a sequence of One-Bit Labels,
             with the most significant bit first.  That is, the One-Bit
             Label in position 17 in the diagram above represents a
             subdomain of the domain represented by the One-Bit Label in
             position 16, and so on.

             The Label field is padded on the right with zero to seven
             pad bits to make the entire field occupy an integral number
             of octets.  These pad bits MUST be zero on transmission and
             ignored on reception.

   A sequence of bits may be split into two or more Bit-String Labels,
   but the division points have no significance and need not be
   preserved.  An excessively clever server implementation might split
   Bit-String Labels so as to maximize the effectiveness of message
   compression [DNSIS].  A simpler server might divide Bit-String Labels
   at zone boundaries, if any zone boundaries happen to fall between
   One-Bit Labels.

3.2.  Textual Representation

   A Bit-String Label is represented in text -- in a zone file, for
   example -- as a &lt;bit-spec&gt; surrounded by the delimiters &quot;\[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;.
   The &lt;bit-spec&gt; is either a dotted quad or a base indicator and a
   sequence of digits appropriate to that base, optionally followed by a



Crawford                    Standards Track                     [Page 2]

RFC 2673        Binary Labels in the Domain Name System      August 1999


   slash and a length.  The base indicators are &quot;b&quot;, &quot;o&quot; and &quot;x&quot;,
   denoting base 2, 8 and 16 respectively.  The length counts the
   significant bits and MUST be between 1 and 32, inclusive, after a
   dotted quad, or between 1 and 256, inclusive, after one of the other
   forms.  If the length is omitted, the implicit length is 32 for a
   dotted quad or 1, 3 or 4 times the number of binary, octal or
   hexadecimal digits supplied, respectively, for the other forms.

   In augmented Backus-Naur form [ABNF],

     bit-string-label =  &quot;\[&quot; bit-spec &quot;]&quot;

     bit-spec         =  bit-data [ &quot;/&quot; length ]
                       / dotted-quad [ &quot;/&quot; slength ]

     bit-data         =  &quot;x&quot; 1*64HEXDIG
                       / &quot;o&quot; 1*86OCTDIG
                       / &quot;b&quot; 1*256BIT

     dotted-quad      =  decbyte &quot;.&quot; decbyte &quot;.&quot; decbyte &quot;.&quot; decbyte

     decbyte          =  1*3DIGIT

     length           =  NZDIGIT *2DIGIT

     slength          =  NZDIGIT [ DIGIT ]

     OCTDIG           =  %x30-37

     NZDIGIT          =  %x31-39

   If a &lt;length&gt; is present, the number of digits in the &lt;bit-data&gt; MUST
   be just sufficient to contain the number of bits specified by the
   &lt;length&gt;.  If there are insignificant bits in a final hexadecimal or
   octal digit, they MUST be zero.  A &lt;dotted-quad&gt; always has all four
   parts even if the associated &lt;slength&gt; is less than 24, but, like the
   other forms, insignificant bits MUST be zero.

   Each number represented by a &lt;decbyte&gt; must be between 0 and 255,
   inclusive.

   The number represented by &lt;length&gt; must be between 1 and 256
   inclusive.

   The number represented by &lt;slength&gt; must be between 1 and 32
   inclusive.

RFC 2673        Binary Labels in the Domain Name System      August 1999


   When the textual form of a Bit-String Label is generated by machine,
   the length SHOULD be explicit, not implicit.

3.2.1.  Examples

   The following four textual forms represent the same Bit-String Label.

                             \[b11010000011101]
                             \[o64072/14]
                             \[xd074/14]
                             \[208.116.0.0/14]

   The following represents two consecutive Bit-String Labels which
   denote the same relative point in the DNS tree as any of the above
   single Bit-String Labels.

                             \[b11101].\[o640]

3.3.  Canonical Representation and Sort Order

   Both the wire form and the text form of binary labels have a degree
   of flexibility in their grouping into multiple consecutive Bit-String
   Labels.  For generating and checking DNS signature records [DNSSEC]
   binary labels must be in a predictable form.  This canonical form is
   defined as the form which has the fewest possible Bit-String Labels
   and in which all except possibly the first (least significant) label
   in any sequence of consecutive Bit-String Labels is of maximum
   length.

   For example, the canonical form of any sequence of up to 256 One-Bit
   Labels has a single Bit-String Label, and the canonical form of a
   sequence of 513 to 768 One-Bit Labels has three Bit-String Labels of
   which the second and third contain 256 label bits.

   The canonical sort order of domain names [DNSSEC] is extended to
   encompass binary labels as follows.  Sorting is still label-by-label,
   from most to least significant, where a label may now be a One-Bit
   Label or a standard (code 00) label.  Any One-Bit Label sorts before
   any standard label, and a 0 bit sorts before a 1 bit.  The absence of
   a label sorts before any label, as specified in [DNSSEC].

RFC 2673        Binary Labels in the Domain Name System      August 1999


   For example, the following domain names are correctly sorted.

                         foo.example
                         \[b1].foo.example
                         \[b100].foo.example
                         \[b101].foo.example
                         bravo.\[b10].foo.example
                         alpha.foo.example

4.  Processing Rules

   A One-Bit Label never matches any other kind of label.  In
   particular, the DNS labels represented by the single ASCII characters
   &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; do not match One-Bit Labels represented by the bit values
   0 and 1.

5.  Discussion

   A Count of zero in the wire-form represents a 256-bit sequence, not
   to optimize that particular case, but to make it completely
   impossible to have a zero-bit label.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines one Extended Label Type, termed the Bit-String
   Label, and requests registration of the code point 000001 binary in
   the space defined by [EDNS0].

7.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations which apply to traditional ASCII DNS
   labels apply equally to binary labels.  he canonicalization and
   sorting rules of section 3.3 allow these to be addressed by DNS
   Security [DNSSEC].

(none)

It should say:

Updates: 1035

Notes:

This document introduces a type of label not explicitly anticipated in the core DNS documents.   Not having an &quot;updating&quot; entry that threads it back to 1035 (or 1034) makes this specification hard to find and likely to be omitted from any compendium or overview of DNS specifications.

The situation is obviously a little complicated by our usual difficulties in updating full standards from documents that are earlier on the standards track or not on the standards track at all.  2673 was published (in 1999) as a Proposed Standard, making an intention to update 1035 well within the rules.   A suggestion then appears to in 3363 (published in 2002) to change it to Experimental, but, since 3363 is itself Informational, it clearly did make that change.  I can find no record of an explicit IESG action making it, but such records are hard to find.   For completeness (of the confusion), RFC 3364 is also listed as updating 2673, but not only is it also Informational, it doesn't even reference 2673 -- one has to deduce the relationship to 2673 by making an inference from the discussion of 2874.

Obviously, while the erratum, and probably one for 1034 with a forward pointer to 2673, should be recorded, the key problem can be fixed by updating the rfc-index and its various clones.

An alternative, which clearly requires IESG and DNSEXT involvement (the above suggestion may or may not do so) is to decide that, after nearly a decade of presumed experience with 2673, either it is useful for something (even if not IPv6 reverse mapping) or that ten years is enough and it isn't worth the trouble.  If it is useful, it should be put it back on the standards track, presumably with an applicability statement about what it is useful for.  If it is not, it is time to make it Historic.  Either decision would clear up the questions of its status vis-a-vis introduction of new label types and updating 1035.
