        AES-CCM Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)

Abstract

   This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
   in the Counter with Cipher Block Chaining - Message Authentication
   Code (CBC-MAC) Mode (CCM) of operation within Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS) to provide confidentiality and
   data origin authentication.  The AES-CCM algorithm is amenable to
   compact implementations, making it suitable for constrained
   environments.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
   [AES] in Counter with CBC-MAC Mode (CCM) [CCM] in several TLS
   ciphersuites.  AES-CCM provides both authentication and
   confidentiality and uses as its only primitive the AES encrypt
   operation (the AES decrypt operation is not needed).  This makes it
   amenable to compact implementations, which is advantageous in
   constrained environments.  Of course, adoption outside of constrained
   environments is necessary to enable interoperability, such as that
   between web clients and embedded servers or between embedded clients
   and web servers.  The use of AES-CCM has been specified for IPsec
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4309] and 802.15.4 wireless
   networks [IEEE802154].

   Authenticated encryption, in addition to providing confidentiality
   for the plaintext that is encrypted, provides a way to check its
   integrity and authenticity.  Authenticated Encryption with Associated
   Data, or AEAD [RFC5116], adds the ability to check the integrity and
   authenticity of some associated data that is not encrypted.  This
   document utilizes the AEAD facility within TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] and the
   AES-CCM-based AEAD algorithms defined in [RFC5116].  Additional AEAD
   algorithms are defined that use AES-CCM but have shorter
   authentication tags and are therefore more suitable for use across
   networks in which bandwidth is constrained and message sizes may be
   small.

RFC 6655                  AES-CCM Ciphersuites                 July 2012


   The ciphersuites defined in this document use RSA or Pre-Shared Key
   (PSK) as their key establishment mechanism; these ciphersuites can be
   used with DTLS [RFC6347].  Since the ability to use AEAD ciphers was
   introduced in DTLS version 1.2, the ciphersuites defined in this
   document cannot be used with earlier versions of that protocol.

</i></div><pre>

   The ciphersuites defined in this document are based on the AES-CCM
   Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms
   AEAD_AES_128_CCM and AEAD_AES_256_CCM described in [RFC5116].  The
   following RSA-based ciphersuites are defined:

             CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM       = {0xC0,0x9C}
             CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CCM       = {0xC0,0x9D)
             CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM   = {0xC0,0x9E}
             CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CCM   = {0xC0,0x9F}
             CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8     = {0xC0,0xA0}
             CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CCM_8     = {0xC0,0xA1)
             CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 = {0xC0,0xA2}
             CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CCM_8 = {0xC0,0xA3}

   These ciphersuites make use of the AEAD capability in TLS 1.2
   [RFC5246].  Each uses AES-CCM; those that end in &quot;_8&quot; have an 8-octet
   authentication tag, while the other ciphersuites have 16-octet
   authentication tags.

   The Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) truncation option
   described in Section 7 of [RFC6066] (which negotiates the
   &quot;truncated_hmac&quot; TLS extension) does not have an effect on cipher
   suites that do not use HMAC.

   The &quot;nonce&quot; input to the AEAD algorithm is exactly that of [RFC5288]:
   the &quot;nonce&quot; SHALL be 12 bytes long and is constructed as follows:
   (this is an example of a &quot;partially explicit&quot; nonce; see Section
   3.2.1 in [RFC5116]).

                       struct {
             opaque salt[4];
             opaque nonce_explicit[8];
                       } CCMNonce;

RFC 6655                  AES-CCM Ciphersuites                 July 2012


   The salt is the &quot;implicit&quot; part of the nonce and is not sent in the
   packet.  Instead, the salt is generated as part of the handshake
   process: it is either the client_write_IV (when the client is
   sending) or the server_write_IV (when the server is sending).  The
   salt length (SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length) is 4 octets.  The
   nonce_explicit is the &quot;explicit&quot; part of the nonce.  It is chosen by
   the sender and is carried in each TLS record in the
   GenericAEADCipher.nonce_explicit field.  The nonce_explicit length
   (SecurityParameters.record_iv_length) is 8 octets.  Each value of the
   nonce_explicit MUST be distinct for each distinct invocation of the
   GCM encrypt function for any fixed key.  Failure to meet this
   uniqueness requirement can significantly degrade security.  The
   nonce_explicit MAY be the 64-bit sequence number (as long as those
   values are assured to meet the distinctness requirement).
<font color='red'><s>

   In DTLS, the 64-bit seq_num is the 16-bit epoch concatenated with the
   48-bit seq_num.

   </s></font></pre><div style='overflow:auto;border:dashed;margin:8px;padding:24px;background-color:#FFFFAF;'><b><i>The preceding text has been updated by Editorial <a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid3761'>Errata 3761</a> to instead read:</i></b><pre style='margin:20px'>

In DTLS, the 64-bit sequence number is the 16-bit epoch concatenated 
with the 48-bit sequence_number in the order they appear on the wire.
</pre><i><b>Errata Notes: </b>

In DTLS 1.2 (RFC 6347, Sec 4.3.1.), the 48 bit sequence number is indicated as sequence_number. There is no mention of seq_num in the DTLS RFC. 
The additional ordering information is used to keep it consistent with MAC computation in DTLS RFC 6347, Sec 4.1.2.1.)

</i></div><pre>
When the nonce_explicit is equal to the sequence number, the CCMNonce
   will have the structure of the CCMNonceExample given below.

              struct {
               uint32 client_write_IV; // low order 32-bits
               uint64 seq_num;         // TLS sequence number
              } CCMClientNonce.


              struct {
               uint32 server_write_IV; // low order 32-bits
               uint64 seq_num; // TLS sequence number
              } CCMServerNonce.


              struct {
               case client:
                 CCMClientNonce;
               case server:
                 CCMServerNonce:
              } CCMNonceExample;

   These ciphersuites make use of the default TLS 1.2 Pseudorandom
   Function (PRF), which uses HMAC with the SHA-256 hash function.  The
   RSA and DHE_RSA, key exchange is performed as defined in [RFC5246].

4.  PSK-Based AES-CCM Cipher Suites

   As in Section 3, these ciphersuites follow [RFC5116].  The PSK and
   DHE_PSK key exchange is performed as in [RFC4279].  The following
   ciphersuites are defined:

             CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM       = {0xC0,0xA4}
             CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CCM       = {0xC0,0xA5)
             CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM   = {0xC0,0xA6}
             CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CCM   = {0xC0,0xA7}
             CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8     = {0xC0,0xA8}
             CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CCM_8     = {0xC0,0xA9)
             CipherSuite TLS_PSK_DHE_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 = {0xC0,0xAA}
             CipherSuite TLS_PSK_DHE_WITH_AES_256_CCM_8 = {0xC0,0xAB}

   The &quot;nonce&quot; input to the AEAD algorithm is defined as in Section 3.

   These ciphersuites make use of the default TLS 1.2 Pseudorandom
   Function (PRF), which uses HMAC with the SHA-256 hash function.  The
   PSK and DHE_PSK key exchange is performed as defined in [RFC5487].

5.  TLS Versions

   These ciphersuites make use of the authenticated encryption with
   additional data (AEAD) defined in TLS 1.2 [RFC5288].  Earlier
   versions of TLS do not have support for AEAD; for instance, the
   TLSCiphertext structure does not have the &quot;aead&quot; option in TLS 1.1.
   Consequently, these ciphersuites MUST NOT be negotiated in older
   versions of TLS.  Clients MUST NOT offer these cipher suites if they
   do not offer TLS 1.2 or later.  Servers that select an earlier
   version of TLS MUST NOT select one of these cipher suites.  Because
   TLS has no way for the client to indicate that it supports TLS 1.2
   but not earlier, a non-compliant server might potentially negotiate
   TLS 1.1 or earlier and select one of the cipher suites in this
   document.  Clients MUST check the TLS version and generate a fatal
   &quot;illegal_parameter&quot; alert if they detect an incorrect version.

6.  New AEAD Algorithms

   The following AEAD algorithms are defined:

        AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8     = 18
        AEAD_AES_256_CCM_8     = 19

RFC 6655                  AES-CCM Ciphersuites                 July 2012


6.1.  AES-128-CCM with an 8-Octet Integrity Check Value (ICV)

   The AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 authenticated encryption algorithm is
   identical to the AEAD_AES_128_CCM algorithm (see Section 5.3 of
   [RFC5116]), except that it uses 8 octets for authentication, instead
   of the full 16 octets used by AEAD_AES_128_CCM.  The
   AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 ciphertext consists of the ciphertext output of
   the CCM encryption operation concatenated with the 8-octet
   authentication tag output of the CCM encryption operation.  Test
   cases are provided in [CCM].  The input and output lengths are the
   same as those for AEAD_AES_128_CCM.  An AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 ciphertext
   is exactly 8 octets longer than its corresponding plaintext.

6.2.  AES-256-CCM with a 8-Octet Integrity Check Value (ICV)

   The AEAD_AES_256_CCM_8 authenticated encryption algorithm is
   identical to the AEAD_AES_256_CCM algorithm (see Section 5.4 of
   [RFC5116]), except that it uses 8 octets for authentication, instead
   of the full 16 octets used by AEAD_AES_256_CCM.  The
   AEAD_AES_256_CCM_8 ciphertext consists of the ciphertext output of
   the CCM encryption operation concatenated with the 8-octet
   authentication tag output of the CCM encryption operation.  Test
   cases are provided in [CCM].  The input and output lengths are as for
   AEAD_AES_128_CCM.  An AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 ciphertext is exactly 8
   octets longer than its corresponding plaintext.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the values for the ciphersuites defined in Sections
   3 and 4 from the &quot;TLS Cipher Suite&quot; registry and the values of the
   AEAD algorithms defined in Section 6 from the &quot;AEAD Algorithms&quot;
   registry.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Perfect Forward Secrecy

   The perfect forward secrecy properties of RSA-based TLS ciphersuites
   are discussed in the security analysis of [RFC5246].  It should be
   noted that only the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman-based ciphersuites are
   capable of providing perfect forward secrecy.

8.2.  Counter Reuse

   AES-CCM security requires that the counter is never reused.  The IV
   construction in Section 3 is designed to prevent counter reuse.
