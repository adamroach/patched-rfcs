1.  Introduction

   SNMP ([RFC3410], [RFC3411]) and SYSLOG [RFC5424] are two widely used
   protocols to communicate event notifications.  Although co-existence
   of several management protocols in one operational environment is
   possible, certain environments require that all event notifications
   be collected by a single system daemon, such as a SYSLOG collector or
   an SNMP notification receiver, via a single management protocol.  In
   such environments, it is necessary to translate event notifications
   between management protocols.

   This document defines an SNMP MIB module to represent SYSLOG messages
   and to send SYSLOG messages as SNMP notifications to SNMP
   notification receivers.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   SYSLOG messages are translated to SNMP by a SYSLOG-to-SNMP
   translator.  Such a translator acts as a SYSLOG collector [RFC5424]
   and implements a MIB module according to the SNMP architecture
   [RFC3411].  The translator might be tightly coupled to an SNMP agent
   or it might interface with an SNMP agent via a subagent protocol.

   After initialization, the SYSLOG-to-SNMP translator will listen for
   SYSLOG messages.  On receiving a message, the message will be parsed
   to extract information as described in the MIB module.  A conceptual
   table is populated with information extracted from the SYSLOG
   message, and finally a notification may be generated.

   The MIB module is organized into a group of scalars and two tables.
   The syslogMsgControl group contains two scalars controlling the
   maximum size of SYSLOG messages recorded in the tables and also
   controlling whether SNMP notifications are generated for SYSLOG
   messages.

   --syslogMsgObjects(1)
     |
     +--syslogMsgControl(1)
        |
        +-- Unsigned32 syslogMsgTableMaxSize(1)
        +-- TruthValue syslogMsgEnableNotifications(2)

   The syslogMsgTable contains one entry for each recorded SYSLOG
   message.  The basic fields of SYSLOG messages as well as message
   properties are represented in different columns of the conceptual
   table.

   --syslogMsgObjects(1)
     |
     +--syslogMsgTable(2)
        |
        +--syslogMsgEntry(1) [syslogMsgIndex]

           +-- Unsigned32      syslogMsgIndex(1)
           +-- SyslogFacility  syslogMsgFacility(2)
           +-- SyslogSeverity  syslogMsgSeverity(3)
           +-- Unsigned32      syslogMsgVersion(4)

           +-- SyslogTimeStamp syslogMsgTimeStamp(5)
           +-- DisplayString   syslogMsgHostName(6)
           +-- DisplayString   syslogMsgAppName(7)
           +-- DisplayString   syslogMsgProcID(8)

           +-- Unsigned32      syslogMsgSDParams(10)
           +-- OctetString     syslogMsgMsg(11)

   The syslogMsgSDTable contains one entry for each structured data
   element parameter contained in a SYSLOG message.  Since structured
   data elements are optional, the relationship between the
   syslogMsgTable and the syslogMsgSDTable ranges from one-to-zero to
   one-to-many.

           |                          syslogMsgSDID,
           |                          syslogMsgSDParamName]
           |
           +-- Unsigned32             syslogMsgSDParamIndex(1)
           +-- DisplayString          syslogMsgSDID(2)
           +-- DisplayString          syslogMsgSDParamName(3)
           +-- SyslogParamValueString syslogMsgSDParamValue(4)

5.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   The NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB [RFC3014] provides a generic mechanism for
   logging SNMP notifications in order to deal with lost SNMP
   notifications, e.g., due to transient communication problems.
   Applications can poll the notification log to verify that they have
   not missed important SNMP notifications.

   The MIB module defined in this memo provides a mechanism for logging
   SYSLOG notifications.  This additional SYSLOG notification log is
   provided because (a) SYSLOG messages might not lead to SNMP
   notification (this is configurable) and (b) SNMP notifications might
   not carry all information associated with a SYSLOG notification.

   The MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC
   [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411], and
   SYSLOG-TC-MIB [RFC5427].

RFC 5676                     SYSLOG-MSG-MIB                 October 2009


   The textual convention SyslogParamValueString uses the UTF-8
   transformation format of the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character set defined
   in [RFC3629].

6.  Relationship to the SNMP Notification to SYSLOG Mapping

   A companion document [RFC5675] defines a mapping of SNMP
   notifications to SYSLOG messages.  This section discusses the
   possibilities of using both specifications in combination.

   A SYSLOG collector implementing the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB module and the
   mapping of SNMP notifications to SYSLOG messages may be configured to
   translate received SYSLOG messages containing SNMP notifications back
   into the original SNMP notification.  In this case, the relevant
   tables of the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB will not be populated for SYSLOG
   messages carrying SNMP notifications.  This configuration allows
   operators to build a forwarding chain where SNMP notifications are
   &quot;tunneled&quot; through SYSLOG messages.  Due to size restrictions of the
   SYSLOG transports and the more verbose textual encoding used by
   SYSLOG, there is a possibility that SNMP notification content will
   get truncated when tunneled through SYSLOG, and thus the resulting
   SNMP notification may be incomplete.

   An SNMP management application supporting the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB and the
   mapping of SNMP notifications to SYSLOG messages may process
   information from the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB in order to emit a SYSLOG message
   representing the SYSLOG message recorded in the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB
   module.  This configuration allows operators to build a forwarding
   chain where SYSLOG messages are &quot;tunneled&quot; through SNMP messages.  A
   notification receiver can determine whether a syslogMsgNotification
   contained all structured data element parameters of a SYSLOG message.
   In case parameters are missing, a forwarding application MUST
   retrieve the missing parameters from the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB.  Regular
   polling of the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB can be used to take care of any lost
   SNMP notifications.

         Since additional code points are added by amendments to the
         10646 standard from time to time, implementations must be
         prepared to encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
         0x7fffffff.  Byte sequences that do not correspond to the
         valid UTF-8 encoding of a code point or that are outside this
         range are prohibited.  Similarly, overlong UTF-8 sequences
         are prohibited.

         UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a single
         character / code point; thus, the length of this object in
         octets may be different from the number of characters
         encoded.  Similarly, size constraints refer to the number of
         encoded octets, not the number of characters represented by
         an encoding.&quot;

     DESCRIPTION
        &quot;A monotonically increasing number used to identify entries in
         the syslogMsgTable.  When syslogMsgIndex reaches the maximum
         value (4294967295), the value wraps back to 1.

         Applications periodically polling the syslogMsgTable for new
         entries should take into account that a complete rollover of
         syslogMsgIndex will happen if more than 4294967294 messages
         are received during a poll interval.&quot;

8.  Usage Example

   The following example shows a valid SYSLOG message including
   structured data.  The otherwise-unprintable Unicode byte order mark
   (BOM) is represented as &quot;BOM&quot; in the example.

    &lt;165&gt;1 2003-10-11T22:14:15.003Z mymachine.example.com
    evntslog - ID47 [exampleSDID@32473 iut=&quot;3&quot; eventSource=&quot;Application&quot;
    eventID=&quot;1011&quot;] BOMAn application event log entry...

   This SYSLOG message leads to the following entries in the
   syslogMsgTable and the syslogMsgSDTable (note that string indexes are
   written as strings for readability reasons):

     syslogMsgIndex.1 = 1
     syslogMsgFacility.1 = 20
     syslogMsgSeverity.1 = 5
     syslogMsgVersion.1 = 1
     syslogMsgTimeStamp.1 = 2003-10-11,22:14:15.003,+0:0
     syslogMsgHostName.1 = &quot;mymachine.example.com&quot;
     syslogMsgAppName.1 = &quot;evntslog&quot;
     syslogMsgProcID.1 = &quot;-&quot;
     syslogMsgMsgID.1 = &quot;ID47&quot;
     syslogMsgMsg.1 = &quot;BOMAn application event log entry...&quot;
     syslogMsgSDParamValue.1.1.&quot;exampleSDID@32473&quot;.&quot;iut&quot;
         = &quot;3&quot;
     syslogMsgSDParamValue.1.2.&quot;exampleSDID@32473&quot;.&quot;eventSource&quot;
         = &quot;Application&quot;
     syslogMsgSDParamValue.1.3.&quot;exampleSDID@32473&quot;.&quot;eventID&quot;
         = &quot;1011&quot;

9.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has assigned value &quot;192&quot; under the &#39;mib-2&#39; subtree and
   recorded the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.

10.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  syslogMsgTableMaxSize: This object controls how many entries are
      kept in the syslogMsgTable.  Unauthorized modifications may either
      cause increased memory consumption (by setting this object to a
      large value) or turn off the capability to retrieve notifications
      using GET class operations (by setting this object to zero).  This
      might be used to hide traces of an attack.

   o  syslogMsgEnableNotifications: This object enables notifications.
      Unauthorized modifications to disable notification generation can
      be used to hide an attack by preventing management applications
      that use SNMP from receiving real-time notifications about events
      carried in SYSLOG messages.  Unauthorized modifications to enable
      notification generation may be used as part of a denial-of-service
      attack against a network management system if, for example, the
      SYSLOG-to-SNMP translator accepts unauthorized SYSLOG messages.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  syslogMsgTableMaxSize, syslogMsgEnableNotifications: These objects
      provide information regarding whether SYSLOG messages are
      forwarded as SNMP notifications and how many messages will be
      maintained in the syslogMsgTable.  This information might be
      exploited by an attacker in order to plan actions with the goal of
      hiding attack activities.

      SYSLOG messages to compromise a machine or do other damage.  It is
      therefore desirable to configure SNMP access control rules,
      enforcing a consistent security policy for SYSLOG messages.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   Using the security features of the SNMPv3 framework secures the
   transport of SYSLOG data via SNMP only.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED
   that deployments use SYSLOG security mechanisms in order to prevent
   attackers from adding malicious SYSLOG data to the MIB tables.

Notes:

Rationale: possible confusion.

&quot;maximum size of SYSLOG messages recorded&quot; conceptionally would
relate to the SIZE of syslogMsgMsg OCTET STRING instances or the
maximum value for syslogMsgSDParams instances, but the DESCRIPTION
clause for the syslogMsgTableMaxSize OBJECT-TYPE in the MIB module
in Section 7 clarifies that this object indicates the maximum
*number* of entries in the syslogMsgTable and does not describe
some filtering criterion (by size) of the SYSLOG messages recorded.

&lt;&lt; see Notes below -- one possibility to address the issue is

         * Notes:
         - the value of year is in network-byte order
|        - the value of microseconds is in network-byte order;
|          users of network management applications following
|          the DISPLAY-HINT specified above should be aware of
|          the unusual appearance of the apparent 'fractional part'
|          displayed: RFC 2579 requires the leading zeros to be
|          omitted; thus a time component diaplayed as '13:30:15.50'
|          does not indicate 50 centiseconds, but 50 microseconds
|          past the full second!
         - daylight saving time in New Zealand is +13


Notes:

(a)

Section 3.1 of RFC 2579 (on page 21) states, regarding numerical
conversion descriptor components in DISPLAY-HINTS:

               [...]  For all types, when rendering a value, leading
   zeros are omitted, and for negative values, a minus sign is rendered
   immediately before the digits.  [...]

Arguably, this means that substrings of OCTET STRING type are
interpreted as *signed* values (in network byte order).
Therefore, the range restriction for the 'year' part specified
informally in the DESCRIPTION clause does not make proper sense;
an upper bound of 65536 is nonsensical anyway since a 2-octet
substring cannot assme 65537 different values; to avoid issues
with different interpretation of RFC 2579, the 'safe' range
0..32767 is recommended -- this should not be a serious restriction
in practice.

(b)
 
WARNING:

According to Section 3.1 of RFC 2579, the components of the
DISPLAY-HINTS string describe the *independent* formatting of
substrings of the OCTET STRING (in this case).
Thus, the display instructions for the conceptional 'seconds'
part of the OCTET STRING, &quot;1d.3d&quot;, actually describes the
independent formatting of a 1-octet and a 3-octet substring
(in network byte order) as decimal integers without leading
zeros, separated by a literal period ('.') -- a &quot;display
separator character&quot; in RFC 2579 terms --, and not the
human-friendly formatting of a single fixed-point fractional
number; there is no concept of a decimal fraction representation
in this notation.
So the presentation format will be very different from common 
practice for human beings. See the example below.
The &quot;fixed-point with decimal sign&quot; representation from
RFC 2579 is only available for INTEGER values, for cases with
scaled values, where the conceptual integer and fractional part
are stored as a single integer in units of the specified
fractional part; it is not applicable to display formats for
OCTET STRING objects.

Elaborating on a slight variant of the example from the RFC, ...
   Tuesday May 26, 1992 at 1:30:15.008 PM EDT
(8 milliseconds past the full 15 seconds), the 'seconds' part
would be represented as 15 seconds 8000 microseconds in four
octets containing 0x0F, 0x00, 0x1F, 0x40, which, together with
the other components, would be rendered as:
    1992-5-26,13:30:15.8000,-4:0
