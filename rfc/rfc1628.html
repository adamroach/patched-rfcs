1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing uninterruptible power
   supply (UPS) systems.

2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

      o    RFC 1442 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
           describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

      o    STD 17, RFC 1213 defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
           objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      o    RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other
           architectural aspects of the framework.

      o    RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network access
           to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

3.  Overview

   This document defines the managed objects for Uninterruptible Power
   Supplies which are to be manageable via the Simple Network Management
   Protocol (SNMP).

       DESCRIPTION
               &quot;A list of alarm table entries.  The table contains
               zero, one, or many rows at any moment, depending upon
               the number of alarm conditions in effect.  The table
               is initially empty at agent startup.  The agent
               creates a row in the table each time a condition is
               detected and deletes that row when that condition no
               longer pertains.  The agent creates the first row with
               upsAlarmId equal to 1, and increments the value of
               upsAlarmId each time a new row is created, wrapping to
               the first free value greater than or equal to 1 when
               the maximum value of upsAlarmId would otherwise be
               exceeded.  Consequently, after multiple operations,
               the table may become sparse, e.g., containing entries
               for rows 95, 100, 101, and 203 and the entries should
               not be assumed to be in chronological order because
               upsAlarmId might have wrapped.

               Alarms are named by an AutonomousType (OBJECT
               IDENTIFIER), upsAlarmDescr, to allow a single table to
               reflect well known alarms plus alarms defined by a
               particular implementation, i.e., as documented in the
               private enterprise MIB definition for the device.  No
               two rows will have the same value of upsAlarmDescr,
               since alarms define conditions.  In order to meet this
               requirement, care should be taken in the definition of
               alarm conditions to insure that a system cannot enter
               the same condition multiple times simultaneously.

               The number of rows in the table at any given time is
               reflected by the value of upsAlarmsPresent.&quot;

</pre><i><b>Errata Notes: </b>

The upper limit of the ranges of upsShutdownAfterDelay and upsStartupAfterDelay points to the intention to use a 32-bit signed integer.
The biggest positive value of a 32-bit singed integer, however, is 2147483647. On a 32-Bit system the upper range given within RFC1628 (2147483648) is so large that is is unsigned, which conflicts with the limitation to 32 bits. 
As 2147483648 seconds is more than 68 years, it seems preferable to change this to 2147483647, loosing 1 second but gaining the ability to be implemented with 32 bits.
