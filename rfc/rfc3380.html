Abstract

   This document is an OPTIONAL extension to the Internet Printing
   Protocol (IPP/1.0 and IPP/1.1).  This document specifies 3 additional
   OPTIONAL operations for use with the Internet Printing Protocol/1.0
   (IPP) and IPP/1.1.  The end user, operator, and administrator Set-
   Job-Attributes and Set-Printer-Attributes operations are used to
   modify IPP Job objects and Printer objects, respectively.  The Get-
   Printer-Supported-Values administrative operation returns values that
   the IPP Printer will accept for setting its &quot;xxx-supported&quot;
   attributes.

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


1 Introduction

   This document is an OPTIONAL extension to IPP/1.0 [RFC2565, RFC2566]
   and IPP/1.1 [RFC2911, RFC2910].  For a description of the base IPP
   documents see Appendix C.

   The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an application level protocol
   that can be used for distributed printing using Internet tools and
   technologies.  IPP version 1.1 [RFC2911, RFC2910] focuses on end user
   functionality with a few administrative operations included.  This
   document defines additional OPTIONAL end user, operator, and
   administrator Set-Job-Attributes and Set-Printer-Attributes
   operations used to modify IPP Job objects and Printer objects,
   respectively.  It also defines a third Get-Printer-Supported-Values
   administrator operation that returns values that the IPP Printer will
   accept for setting its &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attributes.  The Get-Printer-
   Supported-Values operation MUST be supported, if the implementation
   supports setting any &quot;xxx-supported&quot; Printer attributes using the
   Set-Printer-Attributes operation.

   Nine Printer Description attributes are defined:

   printer-settable-attributes-supported (1setOf type2 keyword)
   job-settable-attributes-supported (1setOf type2 keyword)
   document-format-varying-attributes (1setOf type2 keyword)
   printer-message-time (integer(MIN:MAX))
   printer-message-date-time (dateTime)
   printer-xri-supported (1setOf collection)
   xri-uri-scheme-supported (1setOf uriScheme)
   xri-authentication-supported (1setOf type2 keyword)
   xri-security-supported (1setOf type2 keyword)

   Three out-of-band values are defined for use with these three
   operations: &#39;delete-attribute&#39; for deleting Job attributes with the
   Set-Job-Attributes request, &#39;not-settable&#39; for use in either the
   Set-Job-Attributes or Set-Printer-Attributes responses, and &#39;admin-
   define&#39; for use in the Get-Printer-Supported-Values response.

   Two operation attributes: &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; (text) and
   &quot;job-message-from-operator&quot; (text) are defined to set the
   corresponding IPP/1.1 Printer and Job Description attributes with the
   same names.  These operation attributes may be used with any
   operation that affect the Printer or Job object for which an
   operation might want to indicate a message.  For the Set-Job-
   Attributes and Set-Printer-Attributes operations, the client MUST
   explicitly set them, rather than using these operation attributes.

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


   A Printer implementation can make the value of some attributes
   dependent on the document-format, e.g., &quot;resolution-supported&quot;.

2 Terminology

   This section defines terminology used throughout this document.

2.1 Conformance Terminology

   Capitalized terms, such as MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD
   NOT, MAY, NEED NOT, and OPTIONAL, have special meaning relating to
   conformance as defined in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and [RFC2911]
   section 12.1.  If an implementation supports the extension defined in
   this document, then these terms apply; otherwise, they do not.  These
   terms define conformance to this document only; they do not affect
   conformance to other documents, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

2.2 Other terminology

   This document uses terms such as Job object (or Job), IPP Printer
   object (or Printer), &quot;operation&quot;, &quot;request&quot;, response&quot;, &quot;attributes&quot;,
   &quot;keywords&quot;, and &quot;support&quot;.  These terms have special meaning and are
   defined in the model terminology [RFC2911], section 12.2.  The
   following additional terms are introduced in this document:

   READ-ONLY: used in an attribute definition document to indicate that
      the attribute MUST NOT be settable using an IPP protocol Set
      operation.  In other words, the attribute is not settable by
      definition.

   not-settable: an implementation does not support setting an attribute
      (whether or not the attribute&#39;s definition is READ-ONLY).

3 Requirements and Use Cases

   The following requirements and usage are intended to be met by the
   specification in this document.

   1. The end-user and the operator need a way to modify a Job that is
      in the &#39;pending&#39; or &#39;pending-held&#39; state.

      Usage: The end-user discovers that he/she forgot to include a
      print instruction, such as &quot;finishings&quot; = &#39;staple&#39; after
      submitting a job.  Rather than canceling the job and resubmitting
      it to the same IPP Printer, the end-user is able to modify the job
      on the IPP Printer.





Hastings, et. al.           Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


      The operator needs to modify a job because it is requesting a
      particular kind of media for which there is no more, but the
      policy is to print the job on a comparable medium.

   2. The system administrator needs a way to re-configure or change the
      policy of the IPP Printer remotely.

      Usage: The system administrator is adding additional named media
      to the supported media list (setting &#39;name&#39; values to the &quot;media-
      supported&quot; Printer attribute).

      The system administrator is reducing the capability of the IPP
      Printer by removing one of the operations from the supported
      operations list, such as Cancel-Job, because the policy is to run
      the IPP Printer like a public facsimile machine.  After having
      removed Cancel-Job from the list of supported operations, an
      administrative client needs to be able to display to an
      administrator that the implementation is capable of being
      reconfigured to support Cancel-Job once again.

      The system administrator is remotely configuring the IPP Printer
      after installing it, and so is replacing the Printer Description
      attributes that have the out-of-band &#39;no-value&#39; value (see
      [RFC2911], section 4.1) with the proper values.

      The operator is changing the media loaded in the input tray, and
      so is replacing the &quot;media-ready&quot; Job Template Printer attribute
      value with the proper values.

4 Definition of the Set operations

   The Set-Printer-Attributes operations (as are all Printer operations)
   are directed at Printer objects.  A client MUST always supply the
   &quot;printer-uri&quot; operation attribute in order to identify the correct
   target of the operation.  These descriptions assume all of the common
   semantics of the IPP/1.1 Model and Semantics document [RFC2911],
   section 3.1.

   The Set-Job-Attributes operations (as are all Job operations) are
   directed at Job objects.  A client MUST always supply some means of
   identifying the Job object in order to identify the correct target of
   the operation.  That job identification MAY either be a single Job
   URI or a combination of a Printer URI with a Job ID, as defined in
   [RFC2911].  The IPP object implementation MUST support both forms of
   identification for every job.  If possible, a client SHOULD use the
   Printer URI with a Job ID rather than a Job URI, since the 32-bit

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


   &quot;job-id&quot; is more readily translated to and from other print protocols
   that MAY be serving as gateways into or out of the IPP
   implementation.

   The Set Printer operations are summarized in Table 1:

                     Table 1 - Operation-Id assignments

      Operation Name      Operation  Brief description
                          -Id

      Set-Printer-        0x0013     Sets attribute values of the target
      Attributes                     Printer object

      Set-Job-Attributes  0x0014     Sets attribute values of the target
                                     Job object

      Get-Printer-        0x0015     Gets values that are valid for
      Supported-Values               setting &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attributes
                                     using the Set-Printer-Attributes
                                     operation

4.1 Set-Printer-Attributes Operation

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to set the values of the
   attributes of a Printer object.  In the request, the client supplies
   the set of Printer keyword attribute names and values that are to be
   set.  In the response, the Printer object returns success or rejects
   the entire request with indications of which attribute or attributes
   could not be set.

   The Printer object validates the client-supplied attributes in the
   Set-Printer-Attributes request.  For an attribute to validate, it
   MUST meet all of the following rules:

   1. The number of attributes supplied by the client MUST NOT exceed
      the maximum number that the Printer supports in a Set-Printer-
      Attributes request.  A Printer MUST accept at least one attribute,
      but SHOULD accept a reasonable number in a single Set-Printer-
      Attributes request.

      Note: There is no way for the client to determine the maximum
      number of attributes that the Printer supports in a Set-Printer-
      Attributes request, except to try a reasonable number.

   2. The Printer MUST support the attribute.





Hastings, et. al.           Standards Track                     [Page 7]

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


   3. The attribute MUST NOT be READ-ONLY, i.e., the definition of the
      attribute MUST NOT indicate that the attribute is READ-ONLY (see
      Appendix A for an indication of which IPP/1.1 attributes are
      READ-ONLY).

   4. The attribute MUST be settable in this implementation.

   5. The Printer MUST support the value, according to the rules defined
      in Appendix A, i.e., each value of each supplied &quot;xxx&quot; attribute
      MUST be validated against the value of a corresponding &quot;xxx-
      supported&quot; Printer attribute.  One of those rules permits an
      administrator to set arbitrary &#39;name&#39; values to those &quot;xxx-
      supported&quot; Printer attributes that include the &#39;name&#39; attribute
      syntax if the implementation supports the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-
      band value for that &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attribute (see section 8.3 and
      Appendix A).

   6. The attribute&#39;s values MUST NOT conflict with the values of other
      Printer attributes, including ones being set in this same
      operation.

   If any of the supplied attributes are not validate, the Printer
   object MUST reject the entire operation; the Printer object MUST NOT
   partially set some of the supplied attributes.  In other words, after
   the operation, all the supplied attributes MUST be set or none of
   them MUST be set, thus making the Set-Printer-Attributes an atomic
   operation.

   The Printer MUST accept this operation when its READ-ONLY &quot;printer-
   state&quot; attribute (see [RFC2911], section 4.4.11) is &#39;idle&#39; or
   &#39;stopped&#39;, and SHOULD accept it when the value is &#39;processing&#39;.  The
   Printer MUST accept this operation for any of the values of the
   Printer object&#39;s READ-ONLY &quot;printer-state-reasons&quot; and &quot;printer-is-
   accepting-jobs&quot; attributes, unless explicitly defined otherwise in
   the definition of these attributes&#39; values.

   This operation MUST NOT change the value of attributes not specified
   in the operation unless the definition of the attribute explicitly
   specifies such side-effects.  For example, this document explicitly
   specifies that when this operation sets &quot;printer-message-from-
   operator&quot;, the Printer also MUST set the READ-ONLY &quot;printer-message-
   time&quot; and READ-ONLY &quot;printer-message-date-time&quot; attributes to the
   time of the operation as a side effect.  In particular, if this
   operation changes an &quot;xxx-default&quot; attribute, the new value MUST be
   in the &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attributes or the request MUST contain a new
   value for &quot;xxx-supported&quot;, which contains the new value for the
   &quot;xxx-default&quot;.  Otherwise, the Printer MUST reject the operation.  In
   general, Printer attribute definitions that are settable will not



Hastings, et. al.           Standards Track                     [Page 8]

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


   define side-effects on other attributes that are settable, only side
   effects on READ-ONLY attributes, if any.

4.1.1 Settable and READ-ONLY Printer Description attributes

   If the Printer supports the Set-Printer-Attributes operation, then it
   SHOULD support the setting of:

      all Job Template Default (&quot;xxx-default&quot;) attributes
      all Job Template Supported (&quot;xxx-supported&quot;) attributes
      all Job Template Ready (&quot;xxx-ready&quot;) attributes

   that the implementation supports (see [RFC2911] section 4.2 and
   extensions).

   Some Printer Description attributes (see [RFC2911] section 4.4) MUST
   NOT be settable, i.e., they are defined to be READ-ONLY.  An
   attribute marked as &quot;READ-ONLY&quot; in the Printer Description attribute
   table in Appendix A is such an attribute.  The Printer attributes
   that are not marked as &quot;READ-ONLY&quot; MAY be settable using the Set-
   Printer-Attributes operation, depending on implementation.

   Note: From now on, all extensions that define new object attributes
   will indicate whether or not the attributes are READ-ONLY, by
   including the &quot;READ-ONLY&quot; adjective in their descriptions and/or
   explicitly stating whether they MAY be settable.

   The current values of each &quot;xxx-supported&quot; Printer attribute MUST
   reflect the current policy for support of the corresponding &quot;xxx&quot;
   attribute.  If an &quot;xxx-supported&quot; Printer attribute is settable in an
   implementation, then its value(s) MUST affect the behavior of the
   implementation.  If an &quot;xxx-supported&quot; Printer attribute is defined
   to be READ-ONLY or is not-settable in an implementation, then its
   values MUST NOT be settable using the Set-Printer-Attributes
   operation.  Consider the following examples:

      For example, if the &quot;operations-supported&quot; Printer Description
      attribute (see [RFC2911] section 4.4.15) is settable in a
      particular implementation, then changing its value with a Set-
      Printer-Attributes operation MUST affect the operations that the
      implementation accepts or rejects.  Such an implementation will
      need to be able to reject values for operations that it contains
      no code support for (see section 4.3).  If the &quot;operations-
      supported&quot; Printer Description attribute is not settable in a
      particular implementation, then that implementation MUST reject an
      attempt to set it with a Set-Printer-Attributes operation, return
      the &#39;client-error-attributes-not-settable&#39; status code (see
      section 7.1), and return the &quot;operations-supported&quot; attribute,



Hastings, et. al.           Standards Track                     [Page 9]

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


      with the out-of-band &#39;not-settable&#39; value in the Unsupported
      Attributes Group.

      As another example, consider an implementation in which the
      &quot;media-default&quot; and &quot;media-supported&quot; are settable.  If a client
      supplies a Set-Printer-Attributes request that contains the
      &quot;media-default&quot; attribute with a value that is not a member of the
      Printer&#39;s &quot;media-supported&quot; attribute, the Printer MUST reject the
      request and return the &quot;client-error-conflicting-attributes&quot;
      status code with the &quot;media-default&quot; and &quot;media-supported&quot;
      attributes and their values (see [RFC2911] section 3.1.7).

      As a third example, if a client supplies a Set-Printer-Attributes
      request that contains both the &quot;media-default&quot; and the &quot;media-
      supported&quot; attributes, but includes a value in the &quot;media-default&quot;
      that is not a member of the supplied &quot;media-supported&quot; attribute,
      the Printer MUST reject the request and return the &quot;client-error-
      conflicting-attributes&quot; status code with the &quot;media-default&quot; and
      &quot;media-supported&quot; attributes and their values (see [RFC2911]
      section 3.1.7).

   Access Rights: The authenticated user (see [RFC2911] section 8.3)
   performing this operation must be an operator or administrator of the
   Printer object (see [RFC2911] Sections 1 and 8.5).  Most Printer
   attributes will require administrator access rights to set, such as
   &quot;xxx-supported&quot;, while some will require operator access rights only,
   such as &quot;media-ready&quot; and &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot;.  Which
   attributes require which access rights depends on implementation, and
   MAY depend on site policy.

4.1.2 Set-Printer-Attributes Request

   The following sets of attributes are part of the Set-Printer-
   Attributes Request:

   Group 1: Operation Attributes

      Natural Language and Character Set:
         The &quot;attributes-charset&quot; and &quot;attributes-natural-language&quot;
         attributes, as described in [RFC2911], section 3.1.4.1.

      Target:
         The &quot;printer-uri&quot; (uri) operation attribute, which is the
         target for this operation, as described in [RFC2911], section
         3.1.5.

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


      Requesting User Name:
         The &quot;requesting-user-name&quot; (name(MAX)) attribute SHOULD be
         supplied by the client, as described in [RFC2911], section 8.3.

      &quot;document-format&quot; (mimeMediaType):
         The client OPTIONALLY supplies this attribute.  The Printer
         object MUST support this attribute.  This attribute is useful
         for a client to select the document-format to which the
         attribute modification should be applied.  A Printer
         implementation MAY allow some attributes to have different
         values for each document format that it supports.  See
         [RFC2911], section 3.2.5.1 &quot;Get-Printer-Attributes Request&quot;.

         If the client includes this attribute, the Printer MUST change
         the supplied attributes for the document format specified by
         this attribute.  If a supplied attribute is a member of the
         &quot;document-format-varying-attributes&quot; (i.e., the attribute
         varies by document format, see section 6.3), the Printer MUST
         change the supplied attribute for the document format specified
         by this attribute, but not for other document formats.  If a
         supplied attribute isn&#39;t a member of the &quot;document-format-
         varying-attributes&quot; (i.e., it doesn&#39;t vary by document format),
         the Printer MUST change the supplied attribute for all document
         formats.

         If the client omits this attribute, the Printer MUST change the
         supplied attributes for all document formats, whether or not
         they vary by document-format.

         If the client supplies a value for the &quot;document-format&quot;
         Operation attribute, that is either &#39;application/octet-stream&#39;
         or not supported by the Printer, i.e., is not among the values
         of the Printer object&#39;s &quot;document-format-supported&quot; attribute,
         the Printer object MUST reject the operation and return the
         &#39;client-error-document-format-not-supported&#39; status code.
         Note: the document-format &#39;application/octet-stream&#39; is the
         union of several document-formats (see [RFC2911] section
         3.2.5.1, Get-Printer-Attributes) and is not a true document-
         format.

   Group 2: Printer Attributes

      The client MUST supply a set of Printer attributes with one or
      more values (including explicitly allowed out-of-band values) as
      defined in [RFC2911] section 4.2 Job Template Attributes (&quot;xxx-
      default&quot;, &quot;xxx-supported&quot;, and &quot;xxx-ready&quot; attributes), section
      4.4 Printer Description Attributes, and any attribute extensions
      supported by the Printer.  The value(s) of each Printer attribute



Hastings, et. al.           Standards Track                    [Page 11]

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


      supplied in Group 2 replaces the value(s) of the corresponding
      Printer attribute on the target Printer object.  For attributes
      that can have multiple values (1setOf), all values supplied by the
      client replace all values of the corresponding Printer object
      attribute.  If a Printer object attribute had not yet been
      configured, and so assumed the &#39;no-value&#39; out-of-band value (see
      [RFC2911] section 4.1), the supplied value(s) replaces the &#39;no-
      value&#39; value.

4.1.3 Set-Printer-Attributes Response

   The Printer object returns the following sets of attributes as part
   of the Get-Printer-Attributes Response:

   Group 1: Operation Attributes

      Status Message:
         In addition to the REQUIRED status code returned in every
         response, the response OPTIONALLY includes a &quot;status-message&quot;
         (text(255)) and/or a &quot;detailed-status-message&quot; (text(MAX))
         operation attribute, as described in [RFC2911] sections 3.1.6
         and 13.

      Natural Language and Character Set:
         The &quot;attributes-charset&quot; and &quot;attributes-natural-language&quot;
         attributes, as described in [RFC2911], section 3.1.4.2.

   Group 2: Unsupported Attributes

      See [RFC2911], section 3.1.7, for details on returning Unsupported
      Attributes.

      If some of the attributes in the operation fail to validate, the
      Printer MUST reject the operation, MUST NOT change any Printer
      attributes, and MUST return the indicated status code below.  In
      this group, the Printer MUST also return all attributes that fail
      to validate.  The following are the reasons that an attribute
      fails to validate and the value returns for the attribute, along
      with the indicated status code and order of detection:

      1. The number of attributes supplied by the client exceeds the
         maximum number that the Printer supports in a Set-Printer-
         Attributes request: return the &#39;client-error-request-entity-
         too-large&#39; (see [RFC2911], section 13.1.4.9).







Hastings, et. al.           Standards Track                    [Page 12]

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


      2. The Printer doesn&#39;t support the attribute: return the attribute
         with the &quot;out-of-band&quot; value &#39;unsupported&#39; (see [RFC2911]
         section 3.1.7 and [RFC2910]) and the &#39;client-error-attributes-
         or-values-not-supported (see [RFC2911], section 13.1.4.12).

      3. The attribute is either READ-ONLY (in its definition) or is
         not-settable in this implementation: return the attribute with
         the &quot;out-of-band&quot; value &#39;not-settable&#39; (see section 8.1) and
         the &#39;client-error-attributes-not-settable&#39; status code (see
         section 7.1).

      4. The Printer doesn&#39;t support the value: if the attribute in the
         operation has a single value, return it.  If the attribute in
         the operation is multi-valued, return only those values in a
         1setOf that are not supported.  Return the &#39;client-error-
         attributes-or-values-not-supported&#39; status code (see [RFC2911],
         section 13.1.4.12).

      5. The values of some of the supplied attributes conflict with one
         another and/or other Printer attribute values not being set: if
         the conflicting attribute in the operation has a single value,
         return the attribute and the value.  If the attribute in the
         operation is multi-valued, return only the attribute and those
         values in a 1setOf that are conflicting with other attributes.
         Return the &#39;client-error-conflicting-attributes&#39; status code
         (see [RFC2911], section 13.1.4.15).

4.2 Set-Job-Attributes Operation

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to set the values of the
   attributes of a Job object.  In the request, the client supplies the
   set of Job keyword attribute names and values that are to be set.  In
   the response, the IPP object returns success or rejects the entire
   request with indications of which attribute or attributes could not
   be set.

   This operation is almost identical to the Set-Printer-Attributes
   operation and follows the same rules for validation (see section
   4.1).  The only differences are that the Set-Job-Attributes operation
   is directed at a Job object rather than a Printer object, there is no
   &quot;document-format&quot; operation attribute used when setting a Job object,
   the operation can add an attribute to the (Job) object, the &#39;delete-
   attributes&#39; out-of-band value is permitted to remove an attribute,
   and the validation is the same as the Job Creation operations
   (Print-Job, Print-URI, and Create-Job), i.e., depends on the &quot;xxx-
   supported&quot; Printer Description attributes (see [RFC2911] section
   3.1).  Using the Set-Printer-Attributes operation, the administrator
   can set arbitrary &#39;name&#39; values to those &quot;xxx-supported&quot; Printer



Hastings, et. al.           Standards Track                    [Page 13]

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


   attributes, that include the &#39;name&#39; attribute syntax, if the
   implementation supports the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band value for that
   &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attribute (see section 8.3 and Appendix A).  However,
   the Set-Job-Attributes cannot be used to add unsupported names to the
   Job object.

   If a client supplies a job attribute in a Set-Job-Attributes request
   that the Printer supports, and the job was originally submitted
   without supplying that attribute, the Printer adds the attribute to
   the Job object.

   If the client supplies a job attribute with the &quot;out-of-band&quot; value
   &#39;delete-attribute&#39; (see section 8.2), then the Printer MUST remove
   the attribute and all of its values from the Job object, if present.
   The semantic effect of the client supplying the &#39;delete-attribute&#39;
   value in a Set-Job-Attributes operation MUST be the same as if the
   attribute had not been supplied with the Job object in the Job
   Creation operation, i.e., the Printer applies its default attribute
   or behavior with lower precedence that the PDL (see the beginning of
   [RFC2911] section 4.2 and [RFC2911] 3.2.1.1).  Any subsequent query
   of the Job object using Get-Job-Attributes or Get-Jobs, MUST NOT
   return any attribute that has been deleted using the &#39;delete-
   attribute&#39; out-of-band value.  However, a client can re-establish
   such a deleted Job attribute with any supported value(s), using a
   subsequent Set-Job-Attributes operation.

   If the client supplies an attribute in a Set-Job-Attributes request
   with the &#39;delete-attribute&#39; value and that attribute is not present
   on the Job object, the Printer ignores that supplied attribute in the
   request, does not return the attribute in the Unsupported Attributes
   group, and returns the &#39;successful-ok&#39; status code, if there are no
   other problems with the request.

   The validation of the Set-Job-Attributes request is performed by the
   Printer as if the job had been submitted originally with the new
   attribute values (and the deleted attributes removed) and with &quot;ipp-
   attribute-fidelity&quot; set to &#39;true&#39;, i.e., all modified attributes Job
   attributes and values MUST be supported in combination with the Job
   attributes not modified.  If such a Job Creation operation would have
   been accepted, then the Set-Job-Attributes MUST be accepted.  If such
   a Job Creation operation would have been rejected, then the Set-Job-
   Attributes MUST be rejected and the Job MUST be unchanged.  In
   addition, if any of the supplied attributes are not supported, are
   not settable, or the values are not supported, the Printer object
   MUST reject the entire operation; the Printer object MUST NOT
   partially set some of the supplied attributes.  In other words, after





Hastings, et. al.           Standards Track                    [Page 14]

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


   the operation, all the supplied attributes MUST be set or none of
   them MUST be set, thus making the Set-Job-Attributes an atomic
   operation.

   The IPP object MUST accept or reject this operation when the Job&#39;s
   READ-ONLY &quot;job-state&quot; attribute has the values shown in Table 2.  The
   job&#39;s current state MUST affect whether the IPP object accepts or
   rejects the request.  For example, in the case where the operation
   creates a request for unavailable resources, the Job transitions to a
   new state.  Table 2 shows the allowed behaviors in each job state and
   the transitions.

                                     attributes being set, whether the
                                     job has started marking media,

   This operation MUST NOT change the value of attributes not specified
   in the operation unless the definition of the attribute explicitly
   specifies such side-effects.  In general, Job attribute definitions
   that are settable will not define side-effects on other attributes
   that are settable, only side effects on READ-ONLY attributes, if any.

4.2.1 Settable and READ-ONLY Job Description attributes

   If the Printer supports the &quot;job-message-from-operator&quot; Job
   Description attribute (see [RFC2911] section 4.3.16) and the client
   explicitly supplies a new value for the &quot;job-message-from-operator&quot;
   Job Description attribute in Group 2 in the Set-Job-Attributes
   request, then the Printer MUST set the &quot;job-message-from-operator&quot;
   Job Description attribute to this new value.

   If the Printer supports the Set-Job-Attributes operation, then it
   SHOULD support the setting of:

      all Job Template job (&quot;xxx&quot;) attributes

   that the implementation supports (see [RFC2911] section 4.2 and
   extensions).

   Some Job Description attributes (see [RFC2911] section 4.3) MUST NOT
   be settable, i.e., they are defined to be READ-ONLY.  An attribute
   marked as &quot;READ-ONLY&quot; in the Job Description attribute table in
   Appendix A is such an attribute.  The Job attributes not marked as
   &quot;READ-ONLY&quot; MAY be settable using the Set-Job-Attributes operation,
   depending on implementation.

   Note: From now on, all extensions that define new object attributes
   will indicate whether or not the attributes are READ-ONLY, by
   including the &quot;READ-ONLY&quot; adjective in their descriptions and/or
   explicitly stating whether they MAY be settable.

   Access Rights: The authenticated user (see [RFC2911] section 8.3)
   performing this operation must either be the job owner (as determined
   in the Job Creation operation) or an operator or administrator of the
   Printer object (see [RFC2911] Sections 1 and 8.5).

4.2.2 Set-Job-Attributes Request

   The following sets of attributes are part of the Set-Job-Attributes
   Request:

   Group 1: Operation Attributes

      Natural Language and Character Set:
         The &quot;attributes-charset&quot; and &quot;attributes-natural-language&quot;
         attributes as described in [RFC2911], section 3.1.4.1.

      Target:
         Either (1) the &quot;printer-uri&quot; (uri) plus &quot;job-id&quot;
         (integer(1:MAX)) or (2) the &quot;job-uri&quot; (uri) operation
         attribute(s), which defines the target for this operation as
         described in [RFC2911], section 3.1.5.

      Requesting User Name:
         The &quot;requesting-user-name&quot; (name(MAX)) attribute SHOULD be
         supplied by the client, as described in [RFC2911], section 8.3.

   Group 2: Job Attributes

      The client MUST supply a set of Job attributes with one or more
      values (including explicitly allowed out-of-band values) as
      defined in [RFC2911], section 4.2, Job Template Attributes (&quot;xxx&quot;
      attributes), section 4.3, Job Description Attributes, and any
      attribute extensions supported by the Printer.  The value(s) of
      each Job attribute supplied in Group 2 replaces the value(s) of
      the corresponding Job attribute on the target Job object.  For
      attributes that can have multiple values (1setOf), all values
      supplied by the client replace all values of the corresponding Job
      object attribute.

      If the client supplies an &quot;xxx&quot; attribute with the &#39;delete-
      attribute&#39; out-of-band value (see section 8.2), the Printer MUST
      remove the &quot;xxx&quot; attribute from the Job object, if present.

4.2.3 Set-Job-Attributes Response

   The IPP object returns the following sets of attributes as part of
   the Set-Job-Attributes Response:

   Group 1: Operation Attributes

      Status Message:
         In addition to the REQUIRED status code returned in every
         response, the response OPTIONALLY includes a &quot;status-message&quot;
         (text(255)) and/or a &quot;detailed-status-message&quot; (text(MAX))
         operation attribute as described in [RFC2911], sections 3.1.6
         and 13.

      Natural Language and Character Set:
         The &quot;attributes-charset&quot; and &quot;attributes-natural-language&quot;
         attributes as described in [RFC2911], section 3.1.4.2.

   Group 2: Unsupported Attributes

      See [RFC2911], section 3.1.7, for details on returning Unsupported
      Attributes.

      If some of the attributes in the operation fail to validate, the
      Printer MUST reject the operation, MUST NOT change any Job
      attributes, and MUST return the indicated status code below.  In
      this group, the Printer MUST also return all attributes that fail
      to validate.  The following are the reasons that an attribute
      fails to validate and the value returns for the attribute, along
      with the indicated status code and order of detection:

      1. The number of attributes supplied by the client exceeds the
         maximum number that the Printer supports in a Set-Printer-
         Attributes request: return the &#39;client-error-request-entity-
         too-large&#39; (see [RFC2911], section 13.1.4.9).

      2. The Printer doesn&#39;t support the attribute: return the attribute
         with the &#39;unsupported&#39; out-of-band attribute value (see
         [RFC2911], section 3.1.7 and [RFC2910]) and the &#39;client-error-
         attributes-or-values-not-supported (see [RFC2911], section
         13.1.4.12).

      3. The attribute is READ-ONLY (in its definition) or is not-
         settable in this implementation: return the attribute with the
         &#39;not-settable&#39; out-of-band attribute value (see section 8.1)
         and the &#39;client-error-attributes-not-settable&#39; status code (see
         section 7.1).

      4. The Printer doesn&#39;t support the value: if the attribute in the
         operation has a single value return it.  If the attribute in
         the operation is multi-valued, return only those values in a
         1setOf that are not supported.  Return the &#39;client-error-
         attributes-or-values-not-supported&#39; status code (see [RFC2911],
         section 13.1.4.12).

      5. The values of some of the supplied attributes conflict with one
         another and/or other Job attribute values not being set:  if
         the conflicting attribute in the operation has a single value,
         return the attribute and the value.  If the attribute in the
         operation is multi-valued, return only the attribute and those
         values in a 1setOf that are conflicting with other attributes.
         Return the &#39;client-error-conflicting-attributes&#39; status code
         (see [RFC2911],y section 13.1.4.15).

4.3 Get-Printer-Supported-Values Operation

   This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to request the values that
   the Printer allows in the Set-Printer-Attributes operation for &quot;xxx-
   supported&quot; attributes.  If the Printer supports the Set-Printer-
   Attributes operation AND some of its &quot;xxx-supported&quot; Printer
   attributes are settable, then the Printer MUST also support this
   operation.

   The Printer MUST return in the Get-Printer-Supported-Values response,
   those, and only those, &quot;xxx-supported&quot; Printer attributes that it
   supports setting with the Set-Printer-Attributes operation.
   Furthermore, if a client requests the value of an attribute that is
   not settable or is not supported (as in the Get-Printer-Attributes
   response), the Unsupported Attributes Group of the response NEED NOT
   contain the &quot;requested-attributes&quot; operation attribute with any such
   requested (attribute keyword) values.

   This operation has identical request/response attributes to the Get-
   Printer-Attributes operation in IPP/1.1 [RFC2911].  The operation
   also behaves identically to the Get-Printer-Attributes operation in
   IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], with the following exceptions:

   1. The Get-Printer-Supported-Values operation supports only &quot;xxx-
      supported&quot; attributes.

   2. The Get-Printer-Attributes operation returns the few &quot;xxx-
      supported&quot; attributes that are defined to be single valued, such
      as &quot;page-ranges-supported&quot; (boolean) or &quot;pdl-override-supported&quot;
      (type2 keyword), as single values, while Get-Printer-Supported-

      Values returns the possible values that can be set as a 1setOf of
      the same attribute syntax type (See Appendix B: Attributes
      returned from Get-Printer-Supported-Values).

   3. The Get-Printer-Attributes operation returns the current values of
      requested attributes, while the Get-Printer-Supported-Values
      operation returns the values that are inherently supported by the
      implementation code, i.e., the values that an administrative
      client can set in a Set-Printer-Attributes request.

   4. The Get-Printer-Attributes operation returns the current values of
      requested &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attributes that the Printer is
      configured to accept in Job Creation operations, including
      additional values defined by the administrator, while the Get-
      Printer-Supported-Values operation returns only the values of
      &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attributes that are inherently supported by the
      implementation and does not return any additional values defined
      by the administrator, where the implementation supports the
      &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band value.

   5. The Get-Printer-Attributes never returns the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-
      of-band attribute value, while the Get-Printer-Supported-
      Attributes operation does, if the implementation allows the
      administrator to define name values by setting that &quot;xxx-
      supported&quot; attribute with any &#39;name&#39; value(s).

   6. The Get-Printer-Attributes operation only requires end-user access
      rights, while the Get-Printer-Supported-Values requires
      administrator access rights.

   Access Rights: The authenticated user (see [RFC2911], section 8.3)
   performing this operation must be an administrator of the Printer
   object (see [RFC2911], Sections 1 and 8.5).

4.3.1 Definition of the usage of the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band
      attribute value

   If the Set-Printer-Attributes operation allows the System
   Administrator to define arbitrary &#39;name&#39; values for an &quot;xxx-
   supported&quot; attribute, then the Get-Printer-Supported-Values operation
   MUST return the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band attribute value (see
   section 8.3) as one of the values of the &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attribute.
   In other words, the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band attribute value
   indicates that the Printer implementation supports clients setting
   arbitrary &#39;name&#39; attribute syntax values for that &quot;xxx-supported&quot;
   attribute using the Set-Printer-Attributes operation, as long as the
   attribute is defined with the &#39;name&#39; attribute syntax.

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


   For example, if the Get-Printer-Supported-Values operation returns
   several keywords as the value of the &quot;media-supported&quot; attribute,
   then the Set-Printer-Attributes operation MUST accept any of these
   keywords as values for the &quot;media-supported&quot; attribute.  If the Get-
   Printer-Supported-Values operation returns an &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-
   band attribute value as one of the values of the &quot;media-supported&quot;
   attribute, then the Set-Printer-Attributes operation MUST accept any
   value whose attribute syntax is &#39;name&#39;, as a value for the &quot;media-
   supported&quot; attribute (provided that the user is properly
   authenticated to use the Set-Printer-Attributes operation, e.g., has
   administrative access rights).

   The Get-Printer-Supported-Values MAY return the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-
   of-band attribute value for any IPP/1.1 or extension Job Template
   attribute if the implementation supports allowing the System
   Administrator to add values to the &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attribute using
   the Set-Printer-Attributes operation.  In this case, the Printer MUST
   accept any &#39;name&#39; value of the correct attribute syntax in a Set-
   Printer-Attributes operation that is setting that attribute.  For
   &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attributes that are defined with a choice of
   attribute syntaxes, such as &#39;keyword | name&#39;, it is the &#39;name&#39;
   attribute syntax that the System Administrator can use to add new
   values, not the &#39;keyword&#39; attribute syntax.  For IPP/1.1, this
   requirement includes the following Job Template attributes:

      media-supported
      job-hold-until-supported
      job-sheets-supported

   Implementations that support additional Job Template attributes that
   include the &#39;name&#39; attribute syntax, MAY use the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-
   of-band value with them.

   If the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band attribute value is not one of the
   values of an &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attribute returned in a Get-Printer-
   Supported-Values response, then the Printer MUST NOT allow the Set-
   Printer-Attributes operation for that attribute to contain a value
   that is not one of the explicit &#39;keyword&#39; or &#39;name&#39; values returned
   in a Get-Printer-Supported-Values response.

   See Appendix B: Attributes returned from Get-Printer-Supported-Values
   for a full list of values returned by this operation.

5 New Operation attributes

   This section defines new operation attributes for use with the
   IPP/1.1 operations indicated.  As new operations are defined, they
   will also indicate explicitly whether these operation attributes are
   defined for use with them.

5.1 printer-message-from-operator (text(127))

   The Printer SHOULD support this Operation attribute in following
   operations if it supports the corresponding &quot;printer-message-from-
   operator&quot; Printer Description attribute.

      Pause-Printer
      Resume-Printer
      Purge-Jobs

   The client OPTIONALLY supplies this Operation attribute in the above
   operations.  The value of this attribute is a message from the
   operator about the Printer object on which the operator is performing
   the operation.  If this operation attribute is supported, the Printer
   copies the value to its &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; Printer
   Description attribute (see [RFC2911], section 4.4.25), even if this
   Operation attribute is a zero-length text value or consists solely of
   white space.

   If the Printer supports this operation attribute, it MUST support
   both a zero-length text value and the &#39;no-value&#39; out-of-band value
   (see [RFC2911] section 4.1) to indicate that the operator has sent no
   message.  In this case, the Printer sets the value of the &quot;printer-
   message-from-operator&quot; to the zero-length value or &#39;no-value&#39; out-
   of-band value, respectively.  If the client queries the &quot;printer-
   message-from-operator&quot; Printer attribute, the Printer returns the
   attribute with the zero-length value or the &#39;no-value&#39; value,
   respectively.

   In addition, the Printer automatically copies:

   1. the value of its &quot;printer-up-time&quot; attribute (see [RFC2911],
      section 4.4.29) to its &quot;printer-message-time&quot; attribute,

   2. the value of its printer-current-time&quot; (dateTime) attribute (see
      [RFC2911], section 4.4.30) to its &quot;printer-message-date-time&quot;
      attribute, if supported.







Hastings, et. al.           Standards Track                    [Page 22]

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


   If the client omits this operation attribute, the Printer does not
   change the value of its &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot;, &quot;printer-
   message-time&quot; and &quot;printer-message-date-time&quot; Printer Description
   attributes.

   The &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; operation attribute MUST NOT be
   supported as an operation attribute for the Set-Printer-Attributes
   operation.  If the operator wants to set the Printer&#39;s &quot;printer-
   message-from-operator&quot; Printer Description attribute when issuing the
   Set-Printer-Attributes operation, the client supplies the &quot;printer-
   message-from-operator&quot; explicitly with its new value as one of the
   Printer Description attributes in Group 2 in the request; the Printer
   also updates its &quot;printer-message-time&quot; and &quot;printer-message-date-
   time&quot; Printer Description attributes.  If the client does not
   explicitly supply the &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; with its new
   value in the Set-Printer-Attributes request, the Printer leaves the
   value of the Printer&#39;s &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; Printer
   Description attribute unchanged.

5.2 job-message-from-operator (text(127))

   The Printer SHOULD support this Operation attribute in following
   operations if it supports the corresponding &quot;job-message-from-
   operator&quot; Job Description attribute.

      Cancel-Job
      Hold-Job
      Release-Job
      Restart-Job

   The client OPTIONALLY supplies this attribute in the above
   operations.  The value of this attribute is a message from the
   operator about the Job object on which the operator has just
   performed an operation.  If supported, the Printer copies the value
   to the Job&#39;s &quot;job-message-from-operator&quot; Job Description attribute
   (see [RFC2911], section 4.3.16) (even if this Operation attribute is
   a zero-length text value or consists solely of white space).

   If the Printer supports this operation attribute, it MUST support
   both a zero-length text value and the &#39;no-value&#39; out-of-band value
   (see [RFC2911], section 4.1), to indicate that the operator has sent
   no message.  In this case, the Printer sets the value of the &quot;job-
   message-from-operator&quot; to the zero-length value or &#39;no-value&#39; out-
   of-band value, respectively.  If the client queries the &quot;job-
   message-from-operator&quot; Job attribute, the IPP object returns the
   attribute with the zero-length value or the &#39;no-value&#39; value,
   respectively.

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


   If the client omits this attribute, the Printer does not change the
   value of its &quot;job-message-from-operator&quot; Job Description attribute.

   Note: There are no corresponding &#39;job-message-time&quot; and &quot;job-
   message-date-time&quot; Job Description attributes, since the usual
   lifetime of a job is limited.

   The &quot;job-message-from-operator&quot; operation attribute MUST NOT be
   supported as an operation attribute for the Set-Job-Attributes
   operation.  If the operator wants to set the Job&#39;s &quot;job-message-
   from-operator&quot; Job Description attribute when issuing the Set-Job-
   Attributes operation, the client MUST supply the &quot;job-message-from-
   operator&quot; with its new value as one of the Job Description attributes
   in Group 2 in the request.  Otherwise, the Printer leaves the value
   of the Job&#39;s &quot;job-message-from-operator&quot; Job Description attribute
   unchanged by not explicitly setting the attribute.  If the client
   does not explicitly supply the &quot;job-message-from-operator&quot; with its
   new value in the Set-Job-Attributes request, the Printer leaves the
   value of the Job&#39;s &quot;job-message-from-operator&quot; Job Description
   attribute unchanged.

6 New Printer Description Attributes

   The following new Printer Description attributes are needed to
   support the new operations defined in this document.

6.1 printer-settable-attributes-supported (1setOf type2 keyword)

   This REQUIRED READ-ONLY Printer Description attribute identifies the
   Printer object attributes that are settable in this implementation,
   i.e., that are settable using the Set-Printer-Attributes operations
   (see section 4.1).  This attribute MUST be supported if the Set-
   Printer-Attributes operations is supported.  The Printer MUST reject
   attempts to set any Printer attributes that are not one of the values
   of this attribute, returning the &#39;client-error-attributes-not-
   settable&#39; status code (see section 7.1).  The value of this attribute
   MAY depend on the value of the &quot;document-format&quot; operation attribute
   supplied in the Get-Printer-Attributes operation (see [RFC2911],
   section 3.2.5.1).

   Standard keyword values are:

      &#39;none&#39;: There are no settable Printer attributes.
      &#39;xxx&#39;:  Where &#39;xxx&#39; is any of the keyword attribute names allowed
        by section 4.1.1.

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


6.2 job-settable-attributes-supported (1setOf type2 keyword)

   This REQUIRED READ-ONLY Printer Description attribute identifies the
   Job object attributes that are settable in this implementation, i.e.,
   that are settable using the Set-Job-Attributes operation (see section
   4.2).  This attribute MUST be supported if the Set-Job-Attributes
   operations are supported.  The Printer MUST reject attempts to set
   any Job attributes that are not one of the values of this attribute,
   returning the &#39;client-error-attributes-not-settable&#39; status code (see
   section 7.1).

   Standard keyword values are:

      &#39;none&#39;: There are no settable Job attributes.
      &#39;xxx&#39;:  Where &#39;xxx&#39; is any of the keyword attribute names allowed
        by section 4.2.1.

6.3 document-format-varying-attributes (1setOf type2 keyword)

   This OPTIONAL READ-ONLY Printer Description attribute contains a set
   of attribute name keywords.  This attribute SHOULD be supported by a
   Printer object if the Printer object has Printer attributes whose
   value vary depending on document format (see [RFC2911], Get-Printer-
   Attributes operation).  This attribute specifies which attribute
   values can vary by document-format.  If an attribute&#39;s name, &quot;xxx&quot;,
   is a member of this attribute and the value of attribute &quot;xxx&quot; is
   changed with the Set-Printer-Attributes operation that included the
   &quot;document-format&quot; operation attribute, then the Printer MUST change
   the value for the specified document format and no other document
   formats (see section 4.1.2).  If an attribute&#39;s name, &quot;xxx&quot;, is not a
   member of this attribute and the value of attribute &quot;xxx&quot; is changed
   with the Set-Printer-Attributes operation, then the attribute is
   changed for all document formats (whether or not the client supplied
   the &quot;document-format&quot; operation attribute).

6.4 printer-message-time (integer(MIN:MAX))

   This OPTIONAL READ-ONLY Printer Description attribute contains the
   time that the Printer&#39;s &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; was changed
   by the operator using any operation where the client supplied the
   &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; operation attribute (see section 5.1)
   or was explicitly set using the Set-Printer-Attributes operation (see
   section 4.1).  This attribute allows the users to know when the
   &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; Printer Description attribute was
   last set.






Hastings, et. al.           Standards Track                    [Page 25]

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


   The Printer sets the value of this attribute by copying the value of
   the Printer&#39;s &quot;printer-up-time&quot; attribute (see [RFC2911], section
   4.3.14).  If the Printer resets its &quot;printer-up-time&quot; attribute to 1
   on power-up, then it MUST change the value of the &quot;printer-message-
   time&quot; to 0 or a negative number as specified in [RFC2911], section
   4.3.14.

   Note: This attribute helps users better understand the context for
   the &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; message.

6.5 printer-message-date-time (dateTime)

   This OPTIONAL READ-ONLY Printer Description attribute contains the
   date and time that the Printer&#39;s &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; was
   changed by the operator, using any operation where the client
   supplied the &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; operation attribute (see
   section 5.1) or was explicitly set using the Set-Printer-Attributes
   operation (see section 4.1).  This attribute allows the users to know
   when the &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; Printer Description
   attribute was last set.

   This attribute MUST be supported if the Printer supports both the
   &quot;printer-message-time&quot; and the &quot;printer-current-time&quot; (dateTime)
   attributes (see [RFC2911], section 4.4.30).

   Note: This attribute helps users better understand the context for
   the &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; message.

6.6 printer-xri-supported (1setOf collection)

   This OPTIONAL Printer Description attribute is a multi-valued
   attribute where each value has the &#39;collection&#39; attribute syntax (see
   [RFC3382]), containing member attributes with the same semantics as
   the following IPP/1.1 READ-ONLY Printer Description attributes,
   except for cardinality:

      printer-uri-supported (1setOf uri)
          - see [RFC2911], section 4.4.1
      uri-authentication-supported (1setOf type2 keyword)
          - see [RFC2911], section 4.4.2.
      uri-security-supported (1setOf type2 keyword)
          - see [RFC2911], section 4.4.3.

   When setting the &quot;printer-xri-supported&quot; attribute with a Set-
   Printer-Attributes request, the Printer MUST also set these three
   IPP/1.1 READ-ONLY Printer Description attributes as a defined side





Hastings, et. al.           Standards Track                    [Page 26]

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


   effect.  Thus, this collection attribute provides the means to set
   these three IPP/1.1 READ-ONLY attributes atomically so that they are
   never left in a partially inconsistent state.

   An IPP Printer MUST NOT provide any other way, using IPP, to set
   these three IPP/1.1 READ-ONLY Printer Description attributes, since
   they are READ-ONLY and MUST have consistent values at all times.
   Note:  The &quot;printer-xri-supported&quot; (1setOf collection) attribute can
   be put into a directory schema that requires a single text string
   value, such as could be used with SLPv2 [RFC2608], [RFC2609] or
   LDAPv3 [RFC2251], [RFC2252], [RFC2926], by using suitable delimiting
   characters to separate member attributes of the collection and/or
   terminating collection values.

   The member attributes of the &quot;printer-xri-supported&quot; (1setOf
   collection) are given in Table 3.

      Table 3 - Member attributes of &quot;printer-xri-supported&quot; (1setOf
                                collection)

      Member attribute                             client    Printer
                                                   MUST      MUST
                                                   supply    support

      xri-uri (uri)                                yes       yes

      xri-authentication (type2 keyword)           yes       yes

      xri-security (type2 keyword)                 yes       yes

   Other than the uniqueness and the cardinality requirements, the
   semantics of these three member attributes is given in [RFC2911]
   sections 4.4.1, 4.4.2, and 4.4.3, respectively.

   A client can query the current values using the Get-Printer-
   Attributes operation by supplying either:

   1. the three IPP/1.1 attribute names: &quot;printer-uri-supported&quot;, &quot;uri-
      authentication-supported&quot;, &quot;uri-security-supported&quot; and getting
      back the parallel values OR

   2. the single attribute name: &quot;printer-xri-supported&quot; and getting
      back the 1setOf collection which contains the same information
      semantically, but in a different form.

   A client can query what member attribute values can be set by
   supplying the three attribute names: &quot;xri-uri-scheme-supported&quot;,
   &quot;xri-authentication-supported&quot;, and &quot;xri-security-supported&quot; in a



Hastings, et. al.           Standards Track                    [Page 27]

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


   Get-Printer-Supported-Values request and getting back the uriScheme
   and type2 keyword values that can be set.  Since the &quot;printer-xri-
   supported&quot;, &quot;uri-authentication-supported&quot;, and &quot;uri-security-
   supported&quot; attributes are READ-ONLY, they are not queriable with the
   Get-Printer-Supported-Values operation (see section 4.3).  See Table
   16.

   For example:

      &quot;printer-xri-supported =
          {  &quot;xri-uri&quot; = ipp://abc.com/p1
             &quot;xri-authentication&quot; = basic
             &quot;xri-security&quot; = tls
          },
          {  &quot;xri-uri&quot; = ipp://abc.com/p2
             &quot;xri-authentication&quot; = digest
             &quot;xri-security&quot; = tls
          },
          {  &quot;xri-uri&quot; = ipp://abc.com/p3
             &quot;xri-authentication&quot; = none
             &quot;xri-security&quot; = none
          }

   would cause the Printer to set the three corresponding IPP/1.1 READ-
   ONLY attributes, each with three parallel values as follows:

      &quot;printer-uri-supported&quot; = { ipp://abc.com/p1, ipp://abc.com/p2,
                                  ipp://abc.com/p3 }
      &quot;uri-authentication-supported&quot; = { basic, digest, none }
      &quot;uri-security-supported&quot; = { tls, tls, none }

6.7 xri-uri-scheme-supported (1setOf uriScheme)

   This OPTIONAL READ-ONLY Printer Description attribute identifies the
   URI schemes that the implementation supports for use in the
   &quot;printer-uri-supported&quot; (1setOf uri) Printer Description attribute
   (see [RFC2911] section 4.4.1) and the &quot;xri-uri&quot; member attribute of
   the &quot;printer-xri-supported&quot; (1setOf collection) Printer Description
   attribute (see section 6.6).

   A Printer MUST support this attribute if it supports the setting of
   the &quot;printer-xri-supported&quot; (1setOf collection) with the Set-
   Printer-Attributes operation.

6.8 xri-authentication-supported (1setOf type2 keyword)

   This OPTIONAL READ-ONLY Printer Description attribute identifies the
   Client Authentication mechanisms that the implementation supports for
   use in the &quot;uri-authentication-supported&quot; (1setOf type2 keyword)
   Printer Description attribute (see [RFC2911], section 4.4.2) and the
   &quot;xri-authentication&quot; member attribute of the &quot;printer-xri-supported&quot;
   (1setOf collection) Printer Description attribute (see section 6.6).

   A Printer MUST support this attribute if it supports setting the
   &quot;printer-xri-supported&quot; (1setOf collection) with the Set-Printer-
   Attributes operation.

6.9 xri-security-supported (1setOf type2 keyword)

   This OPTIONAL READ-ONLY Printer Description attribute identifies the
   URI schemes that the implementation supports for use in the &quot;uri-
   security-supported&quot; (1setOf type2 keyword) Printer Description
   attribute (see [RFC2911], section 4.4.3) and the &quot;xri-security&quot;
   member attribute of the &quot;printer-xri-supported&quot; (1setOf collection)
   Printer Description attribute (see section 6.6).

   A Printer MUST support this attribute if it supports setting the
   &quot;printer-xri-supported&quot; (1setOf collection) with the Set-Printer-
   Attributes operation.

7 Additional status codes

   This section defines new status codes used by the operations defined
   in this document.

7.1 client-error-attributes-not-settable (0x0413)

   The Set-Printer-Attributes or Set-Job-Attributes operation failed
   because one or more of the specified attributes cannot be set, either
   because the attribute is defined to be READ-ONLY or the attribute is
   not settable in this implementation (see sections 4.1.3 and 4.2.3).
   The Printer MUST return this error code and the attribute keyword
   name(s) and the &#39;not-settable&#39; out-of-band value (see section 8.1) in
   the Unsupported Attributes Group (see [RFC2911], section 3.1.7) for
   all of the attributes that could not be set.  When the Printer
   returns this status, it MUST NOT change any of the attributes
   supplied in the operation.

8 Additional out-of-band values

   This section defines additional out-of-band values.  As with all
   out-of-band values, a client or a Printer MUST NOT use an out-of-band
   value unless the definition of the attribute in an operation request
   and/or response explicitly allows such usage.  See the beginning of
   [RFC2911], section 4.1.

8.1 &#39;not-settable&#39; out-of-band value

   The &#39;not-settable&#39; out-of-band attribute value is returned by the IPP
   Printer in the Unsupported Attributes group of a response to indicate
   that the attribute supplied by the client in the request is READ-ONLY
   by definition or is not settable in this implementation.

   The &#39;not-settable&#39; out-of-band attribute value is defined for use
   with the Set-Job-Attributes and Set-Printer-Attributes responses
   only.  If a future additional &quot;set&quot; operation allows the &#39;not-
   settable&#39; out-of-band value, its definition document MUST indicate
   such use explicitly, including with which attributes.

   An IPP object MUST support the &#39;not-settable&#39; out-of-band value in a
   Set-Job-Attributes or Set-Printer-Attributes request if it supports
   those operations.  A client MUST NOT supply the &#39;not-settable&#39; out-
   of-band value in any request.  An IPP object MUST NOT support the
   &#39;not-settable&#39; out-of-band value in other operations, unless the
   operations&#39; definition document explicitly defines such usage.  If a
   Printer receives this out-of-band value in any operation request, the
   Printer MUST either (1) reject the entire request and return the
   &#39;client-error-bad-request&#39; status code or (2) ignore the attribute
   and return it with the &#39;unsupported&#39; out-of-band value.

   See sections 4.1.3 and 4.2.3 in this document for an example
   definition of the usage of the &#39;not-settable&#39; out-of-band value in
   the Set-Printer-Attributes and Set-Job-Attributes responses.

8.1.1 Encoding of the &#39;not-settable&#39; out-of-band attribute value

   The encoding of the &#39;not-settable&#39; out-of-band value is 0x15 (see
   [RFC2910]).  The value-length MUST be 0 and the value empty.

8.2 &#39;delete-attribute&#39; out-of-band value

   The &#39;delete-attribute&#39; out-of-band attribute value is supplied by the
   client in a request to indicate that the Printer is to remove the
   supplied attribute and all of its values from the target object, if
   present.




Hastings, et. al.           Standards Track                    [Page 30]

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


   The &#39;delete-attribute&#39; out-of-band attribute value is defined for use
   with the Set-Job-Attributes request only.  If a future additional
   &quot;set&quot; operation allows the &#39;delete-attribute&#39; out-of-band value, its
   definition document MUST indicate such use explicitly, including with
   which attributes.

   An IPP Printer MUST support the &#39;delete-attribute&#39; out-of-band value
   if it supports the Set-Job-Attributes operation.  A client MUST NOT
   supply, and an IPP object MUST NOT support, the &#39;delete-attribute&#39;
   out-of-band value in other operations, unless the operations&#39;
   definition document explicitly defines such usage.  For example, the
   &#39;delete-attribute&#39; out-of-band value MUST NOT be used in the Set-
   Printer-Attributes operation, where the absence of an attribute from
   an IPP object indicates that the attribute is not supported.  If a
   Printer receives this out-of-band value in other operation requests,
   the Printer MUST either (1) reject the entire request and return the
   &#39;client-error-bad-request&#39; status code or (2) ignore the attribute
   and return it with the &#39;unsupported&#39; out-of-band value.

   See section 4.2 in this document for the definition of the usage of
   the &#39;delete-attribute&#39; out-of-band value in the Set-Job-Attributes
   request.

8.2.1 Encoding of the &#39;delete-attribute&#39; out-of-band value

   The encoding of the &#39;delete-attribute&#39; out-of-band value is 0x16 (see
   [RFC2910]).  The value-length MUST be 0 and the value empty.

8.3 &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band attribute value

   Section 4.3 defines the Get-Printer-Supported-Values response to
   contain the values of an &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attribute that are supported
   by the implementation before any additional values are defined by the
   administrator.  The &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band attribute value is
   returned as an additional value of an &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attribute in a
   Get-Printer-Supported-Values response to indicate that the
   implementation supports allowing an administrator to define
   additional arbitrary &#39;name&#39; values for that &quot;xxx-supported&quot;
   attribute.

   For example, if the &quot;media-supported&quot; (1setOf (type3 keyword | name))
   attribute contains this value, then the Printer MUST permit an
   administrator to add new media names to the Printer&#39;s &quot;media-
   supported&quot; attribute.  In order for an administrator to add new
   values to a Printer&#39;s &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attribute, the client supplies
   the existing and new values in a Set-Printer-Attributes request for

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


   that attribute.  The client MUST supply any such administratively
   defined values in the Set-Printer-Attributes request, using the
   &#39;name&#39; attribute syntax.

   The &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band attribute value is defined for use
   with the Get-Printer-Supported-Values response only.  A Printer MUST
   NOT return the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band value in a Get-Printer-
   Attributes response, since such a response indicates what an end-user
   client can supply in a Job Creation operation.  If a future
   additional &quot;get&quot; operation allows the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band
   value, its definition document MUST indicate such use explicitly,
   including with which attributes.

   An IPP Printer MUST support the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band value, if
   it supports a client setting arbitrary &#39;name&#39; values of an &quot;xxx-
   supported&quot; Printer attribute using the Set-Printer-Attributes
   operation.  A client MUST NOT supply the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band
   value in any request.  An IPP object MUST NOT support the &#39;admin-
   define&#39; out-of-band value in other operations, unless the operations&#39;
   definition document explicitly defines such usage.  If a Printer
   receives this out-of-band value in any operation request, the Printer
   MUST either (1) reject the entire request and return the &#39;client-
   error-bad-request&#39; status code or (2) ignore the attribute and return
   it with the &#39;unsupported&#39; out-of-band value.

   This document defines that the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band value MUST
   be used only with &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attributes that are defined to
   include the &#39;name&#39; attribute syntax.  This out-of-band value is not
   intended to be used with &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attributes of other
   attribute syntaxes, such as &#39;uri&#39;, even though the administrator
   defines arbitrary values for such attributes.  If other documents
   extend the use of the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band value to other
   attribute syntaxes, such a document MUST define such use explicitly,
   including with which attributes.

   See section 4.3 in this document for an example definition of the
   usage of the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band attribute value in any &quot;xxx-
   supported&quot; attribute returned in a Get-Printer-Supported-Values
   response that is defined to include the &#39;name&#39; attribute syntax.

8.3.1 Encoding of the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band attribute value

   The encoding of the &#39;admin-define&#39; out-of-band attribute value is
   0x17 (see [RFC2910]).  The value-length MUST be 0 and the value
   empty.

9 New Values for Existing Printer Description Attributes

   This section contains those attributes for which additional values
   are added.

9.1 operations-supported (1setOf type2 enum)

   The following &quot;operation-id&quot; values are added in order to support the
   new operations defined in this document:

                Table 4 - Operation-id assignments

                Value        Operation Name

                0x0013       Set-Printer-Attributes

                0x0014       Set-Job-Attributes

                0x0015       Get-Printer-Supported-Values

10 Conformance Requirements

   This section specifies the conformance requirements for clients and
   IPP objects.

   Both the Set-Job-Attributes and the Set-Printer-Attributes operations
   defined in the document are OPTIONAL for an IPP object to support.
   Either one MAY be supported without the other or both MAY be
   supported.  However, if the Set-Printer-Attributes operation is
   supported, then the Get-Printer-Supported-Values operation MUST be
   supported if any &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attributes are settable.  Otherwise,
   the Get-Printer-Supported-Values operation is OPTIONAL for an IPP
   Printer to support.

   If the Set-Printer-Attributes operation is supported, then the
   Printer MUST support the following additional items:

      1. the Get-Printer-Supported-Values operation (see section 5), if
         any &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attributes are settable.

      2. the &quot;printer-settable-attributes-supported&quot; Printer Description
         attribute (see section 6.1).

      3. the &#39;not-settable&#39; out-of-band value in responses (see section
         8.1).

      4. the &#39;client-error-not-settable&#39; status code (see section 7.1).

RFC 3380          IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations     September 2002


      5. if the &quot;printer-message-from-operator&quot; Printer Description
         attribute is supported (see [RFC2911], section 4.4.25), then it
         MUST be settable.

      6. the Get-Printer-Supported-Values operation (see section 4.3),
         if any &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attributes are settable.

      7. If a client can set a value with the &#39;name&#39; attribute syntax
         for one or more &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attributes, then the &#39;admin-
         define&#39; out-of-band attribute value (see section 8.3) MUST be
         supported in the Get-Printer-Supported-Values response for each
         such settable attribute (see section 4.3)

   If the Set-Job-Attributes operation is supported, then the Printer
   MUST support the following additional items:

      1. the &quot;job-settable-attributes-supported&quot; Printer Description
         attribute (see section 6.2).

      2. the &#39;not-settable&#39; out-of-band value in responses (see section
         8.1).

      3. the &#39;delete-attribute&#39; out-of-band value in requests (see
         section 8.2).

      4. the &#39;client-error-not-settable&#39; status code (see section 7.1).
<font color='red'><s>

      5. if the &quot;job-message-from-operator&quot; Printer Description
         attribute is supported (see [RFC2911], 4.3.16), then it MUST be
         settable.

      5. if the &quot;job-message-from-operator&quot; Job Description
         attribute is supported (see [RFC2911], 4.3.16), then it MUST be
         settable.

</pre><i><b>Errata Notes: </b>

&quot;job-message-from-operator&quot; is an attribute for Jobs, not Printers.

</i></div><pre>
It is OPTIONAL for the Printer object to support the &quot;printer-
   message-time&quot; (integer) and &quot;printer-message-date-time&quot; (dateTime)
   Printer Description attributes.  If both the &quot;printer-message-time&quot;
   (integer) and the &quot;printer-current-time&quot; (dateTime) (see [RFC2911],
   section 4.4.30) attributes are supported, then the &quot;printer-message-
   date-time&quot; (dateTime) Printer Description attribute MUST be
   supported.

   As with all out-of-band values, a client or a Printer MUST NOT use an
   out-of-band value, unless the definition document for the attribute
   in an operation request and/or response explicitly allows such usage.

12 Internationalization Considerations

   This document has the same localization considerations as [RFC2911].

13 Security Considerations

   The IPP Model and Semantics document ([RFC2911], section 8) discusses
   high level security requirements (Client Authentication, Server
   Authentication and Operation Privacy).  Client Authentication is the
   mechanism by which the client proves its identity to the server in a
   secure manner.  Server Authentication is the mechanism by which the
   server proves its identity to the client in a secure manner.
   Operation Privacy is defined as a mechanism for protecting operations
   from eavesdropping.

   In addition, the introduction of the Set-Printer-Attributes and Set-
   Job-Attributes operations creates another security threat, since the
   client is able to modify the Printer and Job attributes stored in the
   Printer.  Such modifications could lead to denial of service.

   A malicious user could alter the policy established by the system
   administrator and stored in the Printer attributes.  Such alteration
   could either grant access to more resources or deny access to
   resources that the system administrator has established.  For
   example, the malicious user could remove all of the document-format
   values from the &quot;document-format-supported&quot; Printer attribute so that
   the Printer would refuse to accept all jobs.

   The general remedy for such malicious user actions against Printer
   attributes is to have strong Client Authentication coupled with
   Printer access control, to limit the users who have System
   Administrator or Operator privileges.

   A malicious user could modify the Job Template attributes of another
   user&#39;s Job, such as the &quot;copies&quot; attribute.  For example, setting the
   number of copies to a large number.

   The general remedy for such malicious user actions against another
   user&#39;s job is to have strong Client Authentication coupled with
   Printer access control to limit the users who have System
   Administrator or Operator privileges who can modify any job and, in
   addition, store the Client Authentication with each Job so that only
   the job owner End User can modify his/her own job.

Appendix A: Allowed Values for Set-Printer-Attributes and
            Set-Job-Attributes requests (Normative)

   This appendix is a normative part of this document and contains a
   table of all IPP/1.1 attributes.  Each row contains:

      -  an attribute and

      -  the values allowed in the Set-Printer-Attributes or Set-Job-
         Attributes request for the attribute.  The entry in each cell
         is the name (first few words) of each item below 1, 2, 3, 4a-g,
         and 5.

   The allowed values include the following cases:

      1. READ-ONLY: the Set-Printer-Attributes or Set-Job-Attributes
         operation MUST NOT change this attribute and MUST reject the
         entire operation (see section 7.1).

      2. Any of  &quot;xxx-supported&quot;: the  Set-Printer-Attributes or Set-
         Job-Attributes operation accepts values that are allowed
         according to the IPP/1.1 rules for validating the value(s) of
         an &quot;xxx&quot; Printer or Job attribute against the value(s) of the
         corresponding &quot;xxx-supported&quot; Printer attribute.  Table 5
         summarizes those validation rules depending on each attribute
         syntax and value of an &quot;xxx&quot; attribute supplied in the request
         and that of the corresponding &quot;xxx-supported&quot; Printer
         attribute.  The &quot;xxx-supported&quot; attribute syntax type and
         value(s) are obtained from a Get-Printer-Supported-Values
         response (see the tables in this Appendix).

      3. From Get-Printer-Supported-Values: the  Set-Printer-Attributes
         operation accepts values that are allowed according to the
         IPP/1.1 rules for validating the value(s) of an &quot;xxx&quot; Printer
         attribute against the value(s) of the corresponding &quot;xxx-
         supported&quot; Printer attribute.  Table 6 summarizes those
         validation rules depending on each attribute syntax and value
         of an &quot;xxx&quot; attribute supplied in the request and that of the
         corresponding &quot;xxx-supported&quot; Printer attribute.  The &quot;xxx-
         supported&quot; attribute syntax type and attribute value(s) are
         obtained from a Get-Printer-Supported-Values response (see
         Appendix B: Attributes returned from Get-Printer-Supported-

   Get-Printer-Supported-Values response, i.e., all the &quot;xxx-supported&quot;
   attributes that can be supplied in a Set-Printer-Attributes request.
   READ-ONLY attributes MUST NOT be returned in a Get-Printer-
   Supported-Values response and are indicated in the tables as &quot;READ-
   ONLY - MUST NOT be returned.&quot;

   For the following attributes, the value allowed by the Set-Printer-
   Attributes operation MUST be a single integer value in the range
   specified by the value returned by the Get-Printer-Supported-Values
   operation.

   uriScheme, mimeMediaType or resolution value matches if it is equal.
   For Job Template attributes, with the attribute syntax &#39;type3 keyword
   | name&#39;, any &#39;name&#39; attribute syntax value matches the &#39;admin-define&#39;
   out-of-band value, if the implementation allows the administrator to
   set any name values for the attribute.

Appendix C: Description of the Base IPP Documents (Informative)

   The base set of IPP documents includes:

      Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol [RFC2567]
      Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the
      Internet Printing Protocol [RFC2568]
      Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics [RFC2911]
      Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport [RFC2910]
      Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer&#39;s Guide [RFC3196]
      Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols [RFC2569]

   The &quot;Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol&quot; document takes a
   broad look at distributed printing functionality, and it enumerates
   real-life scenarios that help to clarify the features that need to be
   included in a printing protocol for the Internet.  It identifies
   requirements for three types of users: end users, operators, and
   administrators.  It calls out a subset of end user requirements that
   are satisfied in IPP/1.0 [RFC2566, RFC2565].  A few OPTIONAL operator
   operations have been added to IPP/1.1 [RFC2911, RFC2910].

   The &quot;Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the
   Internet Printing Protocol&quot; document describes IPP from a high level
   view, defines a roadmap for the various documents that form the suite
   of IPP specification documents, and gives background and rationale
   for the IETF IPP working group&#39;s major decisions.

   The &quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot; document
   describes a simplified model with abstract objects, their attributes,
   and their operations.  The model introduces a Printer and a Job.  The
   Job supports multiple documents per Job.  The model document also
   addresses how security, internationalization, and directory issues
   are addressed.

   The &quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport&quot; document
   is a formal mapping of the abstract operations and attributes defined
   in the model document onto HTTP/1.1 [RFC2616].  It also defines the
   encoding rules for a new Internet MIME media type called
   &quot;application/ipp&quot;.  This document also defines the rules for
   transporting over HTTP, a message body whose Content-Type is
   &quot;application/ipp&quot;.  This document defines the &#39;ipp&#39; scheme for
   identifying IPP printers and jobs.

   The &quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer&#39;s Guide&quot; document
   gives insight and advice to implementers of IPP clients and IPP
   objects.  It is intended to help them understand IPP/1.1 and some of
   the considerations that may assist them in the design of their client

   and/or IPP object implementations.  For example, a typical order of
   processing requests is given, including error checking.  Motivation
   for some of the specification decisions are also included.

   The &quot;Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols&quot; document gives some
   advice to implementers of gateways between IPP and LPD (Line Printer
   Daemon) implementations.
