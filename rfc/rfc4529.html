Abstract

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) search operation
   provides mechanisms for clients to request all user application
   attributes, all operational attributes, and/or attributes selected by
   their description.  This document extends LDAP to support a mechanism
   that LDAP clients may use to request the return of all attributes of
   an object class.

   In the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC4510], the
   search operation [RFC4511] supports requesting the return of a set of
   attributes.  This set is determined by a list of attribute
   descriptions.  Two special descriptors are defined to request all
   user attributes (&quot;*&quot;) [RFC4511] and all operational attributes (&quot;+&quot;)
   [RFC3673].  However, there is no convenient mechanism for requesting
   pre-defined sets of attributes such as the set of attributes used to
   represent a particular class of object.

RFC 4529         Requesting Attributes by Object Class         June 2006


   This document extends LDAP to allow an object class identifier to be
   specified in attributes lists, such as in Search requests, to request
   the return of all attributes belonging to an object class.  The
   COMMERCIAL AT (&quot;@&quot;, U+0040) character is used to distinguish an
   object class identifier from an attribute descriptions.

   For example, the attribute list of &quot;@country&quot; is equivalent to the
   attribute list of &#39;c&#39;, &#39;searchGuide&#39;, &#39;description&#39;, and
   &#39;objectClass&#39;.  This object class is described in [RFC4519].

   This extension is intended primarily to be used where the user is in
   direct control of the parameters of the LDAP search operation, for
   instance when entering an LDAP URL [RFC4516] into a web browser, such
   as &lt;ldap:///dc=example,dc=com?@organization?base&gt;.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;,
   &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;,
   and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
   [RFC2119].

   DSA stands for Directory System Agent (or server).
   DSE stands for DSA-specific Entry.

3.  Return of All Attributes of an Object Class

   When the control is attached to an LDAP request, the processing of
   the request is conditional on the evaluation of the Filter as applied
   against the target of the operation.  If the Filter evaluates to
   TRUE, then the request is processed normally.  If the Filter
   evaluates to FALSE or Undefined, then assertionFailed (122)
   resultCode is returned, and no further processing is performed.

   This extension allows object class identifiers to be provided in the
   attributes field of the LDAP SearchRequest [RFC4511] or other request
   values of the AttributeSelection data type (e.g., attributes field in
   pre/post read controls [ReadEntry]) and/or &lt;attributeSelector&gt;
   production (e.g., attributes of an LDAP URL [RFC4516]).  For each
   object class identified in the attributes field, the request is to be
   treated as if each attribute allowed by that class (by &quot;MUST&quot; or
   &quot;MAY&quot;, directly or by &quot;SUP&quot;erior) [RFC4512] were itself listed.

   This extension extends the &lt;attributeSelector&gt; [RFC4511] production
   as indicated by the following ABNF [RFC4234]:

        attributeSelector =/ objectclassdescription
        objectclassdescription = ATSIGN oid options
        ATSIGN = %x40 ; COMMERCIAL AT (&quot;@&quot; U+0040)

   where &lt;oid&gt; and &lt;options&gt; productions are as defined in [RFC4512].

RFC 4529         Requesting Attributes by Object Class         June 2006


   The &lt;oid&gt; component of an &lt;objectclassdescription&gt; production
   identifies the object class by short name (descr) or object
   identifier (numericoid).  If the value of the &lt;oid&gt; component is
   unrecognized or does not refer to an object class, the object class
   description is to be treated as an unrecognized attribute
   description.

   The &lt;options&gt; production is included in the grammar for extensibility
   purposes.  An object class description with an unrecognized or
   inappropriate option is to be treated as unrecognized.

   Although object class description options and attribute description
   options share the same syntax, they are not semantically related.
   This document does not define any object description option.

   Servers supporting this feature SHOULD publish the object identifier
   (OID) 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.5.2 as a value of the &#39;supportedFeatures&#39;
   [RFC4512] attribute in the root DSE.  Clients supporting this feature
   SHOULD NOT use the feature unless they know that the server supports
   it.

4.  Security Considerations

   This extension provides a shorthand for requesting all attributes of
   an object class.  Because these attributes could have been listed
   individually, introduction of this shorthand is not believed to raise
   additional security considerations.

   Implementors of this LDAP extension should be familiar with security
   considerations applicable to the LDAP search operation [RFC4511], as
   well as with general LDAP security considerations [RFC4510].

5.  IANA Considerations

   Registration of the LDAP Protocol Mechanism [RFC4520] defined in this
   document has been completed.
