1. Abstract

   A new URL scheme, &quot;data&quot;, is defined. It allows inclusion of small
   data items as &quot;immediate&quot; data, as if it had been included
   externally.

2. Description

   Some applications that use URLs also have a need to embed (small)
   media type data directly inline. This document defines a new URL
   scheme that would work like &#39;immediate addressing&#39;. The URLs are of
   the form:

                    data:[&lt;mediatype&gt;][;base64],&lt;data&gt;
<font color='red'><s>

   The &lt;mediatype&gt; is an Internet media type specification (with
   optional parameters.) </s></font></pre><div style='overflow:auto;border:dashed;margin:8px;padding:24px;background-color:#FFFFAF;'><b><i>The preceding text has been updated by Editorial <a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid4124'>Errata 4124</a> to instead read:</i></b><pre style='margin:20px'>

   The &lt;mediatype&gt; is an Internet media type specification (with
   optional parameters).
</pre><i><b>Errata Notes: </b>

Periods go inside parentheses only if an entire sentence is inside the parentheses.

</i></div><pre>
The appearance of &quot;;base64&quot; means that the data
   is encoded as base64. Without &quot;;base64&quot;, the data (as a sequence of
   octets) is represented using ASCII encoding for octets inside the
   range of safe URL characters and using the standard %xx hex encoding
   of URLs for octets outside that range.  If &lt;mediatype&gt; is omitted, it
   defaults to text/plain;charset=US-ASCII.  As a shorthand,
   &quot;text/plain&quot; can be omitted but the charset parameter supplied.

   The &quot;data:&quot; URL scheme is only useful for short values. Note that
   some applications that use URLs may impose a length limit; for
   example, URLs embedded within &lt;A&gt; anchors in HTML have a length limit
   determined by the SGML declaration for HTML [RFC1866]. The LITLEN
   (1024) limits the number of characters which can appear in a single

   attribute value literal, the ATTSPLEN (2100) limits the sum of all
   lengths of all attribute value specifications which appear in a tag,
   and the TAGLEN (2100) limits the overall length of a tag.

   The &quot;data&quot; URL scheme has no relative URL forms.

3. Syntax

</pre><div style='overflow:auto;border:dashed;margin:8px;padding:24px;background-color:#FFFFAF;'><b><i>Technical <a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid3214'>Errata 3214</a> updates this section as follows:</i></b><br/><pre style='margin:20px'>Section 3 says:


   Attribute values in [RFC2045] are allowed to be either represented as
   tokens or as quoted strings. However, within a &quot;data&quot; URL, the
   &quot;quoted-string&quot; representation would be awkward, since the quote mark
   is itself not a valid urlchar. For this reason, parameter values
   should use the URL Escaped encoding instead of quoted string if the
   parameter values contain any &quot;tspecial&quot;.

Notes:

This advice does not work when the character is a delimiter such as &quot;;&quot;.

Example media type:

  text/plain;foo=&quot;bar;charset=iso-8859-1&quot;;charset=UTF-8

...represented as-is in data uri:

  data:text/plain;foo=%22bar;charset=iso-8859-1%22;charset=UTF-8,...

...but following the advice from Section 3:

  data:text/plain;foo=bar;charset=iso-8859-1;charset=UTF-8,...

which makes the charset parameter ambiguous.

Proposal for document update:

1) Keep the text pointing out double quotes will look awkward.

2) Insist on them being handled as per RFC 2045, when present.

3) Either remove the last sentence (after checking whether it's done in practice), or clarify which additional non-token characters are allowed here.

</pre><i><b>Errata Notes: </b>

&quot;urlchar&quot; is not defined in RFC2396, but &quot;uric&quot; is (which I think is what was supposed to be used).

</i></div><pre>
Attribute values in [RFC2045] are allowed to be either represented as
   tokens or as quoted strings. However, within a &quot;data&quot; URL, the
   &quot;quoted-string&quot; representation would be awkward, since the quote mark
   is itself not a valid urlchar. For this reason, parameter values
   should use the URL Escaped encoding instead of quoted string if the
   parameter values contain any &quot;tspecial&quot;.

   The &quot;;base64&quot; extension is distinguishable from a content-type
   parameter by the fact that it doesn&#39;t have a following &quot;=&quot; sign.

4. Examples

   A data URL might be used for arbitrary types of data. The URL

                          data:,A%20brief%20note

   encodes the text/plain string &quot;A brief note&quot;, which might be useful
   in a footnote link.

RFC 2397                 The &quot;data&quot; URL scheme               August 1998


   could be used for a small inline image in a HTML document.  (The
   embedded image is probably near the limit of utility. For anything
   else larger, data URLs are likely to be inappropriate.)

   A data URL scheme&#39;s media type specification can include other
   parameters; for example, one might specify a charset parameter.
<font color='red'><s>

      data:text/plain;charset=iso-8859-7,%be%fg%be

   </s></font></pre><div style='overflow:auto;border:dashed;margin:8px;padding:24px;background-color:#FFFFAF;'><b><i>The preceding text has been updated by Technical <a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid2009'>Errata 2009</a> to instead read:</i></b><pre style='margin:20px'>

data:text/plain;charset=iso-8859-7,%be%d3%be
</pre><i><b>Errata Notes: </b>

The given hex encoding &quot;%fg&quot; is incorrect, because there is no hexadecimal digit &quot;g&quot; (&quot;f&quot; is last). A correct hex encoding of any character is permissible here.

</i></div><pre>
can be used for a short sequence of greek characters.

   Some applications may use the &quot;data&quot; URL scheme in order to provide
   setup parameters for other kinds of networking applications. For
   example, one might create a media type
           application/vnd-xxx-query

   whose content consists of a query string and a database identifier
   for the &quot;xxx&quot; vendor&#39;s databases. A URL of the form:

   data:application/vnd-xxx-
   query,select_vcount,fcol_from_fieldtable/local

   could then be used in a local application to launch the &quot;helper&quot; for
   application/vnd-xxx-query and give it the immediate data included.

5. History

   This idea was originally proposed August 1995. Some versions of the
   data URL scheme have been used in the definition of VRML, and a
   version has appeared as part of a proposal for embedded data in HTML.
   Various changes have been made, based on requests, to elide the media
   type, pack the indication of the base64 encoding more tightly, and
   eliminate &quot;quoted printable&quot; as an encoding since it would not easily
   yield valid URLs without additional %xx encoding, which itself is
   sufficient. The &quot;data&quot; URL scheme is in use in VRML, new applications
   of HTML, and various commercial products. It is being used for object
   parameters in Java and ActiveX applications.

6. Security

   Interpretation of the data within a &quot;data&quot; URL has the same security
   considerations as any implementation of the given media type.  An
   application should not interpret the contents of a data URL which is
   marked with a media type that has been disallowed for processing by
   the application&#39;s configuration.

RFC 2397                 The &quot;data&quot; URL scheme               August 1998


   Sites which use firewall proxies to disallow the retrieval of certain
   media types (such as application script languages or types with known
   security problems) will find it difficult to screen against the
   inclusion of such types using the &quot;data&quot; URL scheme.  However, they
   should be aware of the threat and take whatever precautions are
   considered necessary within their domain.

   The effect of using long &quot;data&quot; URLs in applications is currently
   unknown; some software packages may exhibit unreasonable behavior
   when confronted with data that exceeds its allocated buffer size.
