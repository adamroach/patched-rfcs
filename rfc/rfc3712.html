Abstract

   This document defines a schema, object classes and attributes, for
   printers and printer services, for use with directories that support
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol v3 (LDAP-TS).  This document is
   based on the printer attributes listed in Appendix E of Internet
   Printing Protocol/1.1 (IPP) (RFC 2911).  A few additional printer
   attributes are based on definitions in the Printer MIB (RFC 1759).

RFC 3712            LDAP Schema for Printer Services       February 2004


1.  Introduction

   This document defines several object classes to provide Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol v3 [LDAP-TS] applications with flexible
   options in defining printer information using LDAP schema.  Classes
   are provided for defining directory entries with common printer
   information as well as for extending existing directory entries with
   SLPv2 [RFC2608], IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], and LPR [RFC1179] specific
   information.

   The schema defined in this document is based on the printer
   attributes listed in Appendix E &#39;Generic Directory Schema&#39; of
   Internet Printing Protocol/1.1 (IPP) [RFC2911].  A few additional
   printer attributes are based on definitions in the Printer MIB
   [RFC1759].

   The schema defined in this document is technically aligned with the
   stable IANA-registered &#39;service:printer:&#39; v2.0 template [SLP-PRT],
   for compatibility with already deployed Service Location Protocol
   (SLPv2) [RFC2608] service advertising and discovery infrastructure.
   The attribute syntaxes are technically aligned with the
   &#39;service:printer:&#39; v2.0 template - therefore simpler types are
   sometimes used (for example, &#39;DirectoryString&#39; [RFC2252] rather than
   &#39;labeledURI&#39; [RFC2079] for the &#39;printer-uri&#39; attribute).

   Please send comments directly to the authors at the addresses listed
   in Section 13 &quot;Authors&#39; Addresses&quot;.

1.1.  Rationale for using DirectoryString Syntax

   The attribute syntax &#39;DirectoryString&#39; (UTF-8 [RFC2279]) defined in
   [RFC2252] is specified for several groups of string attributes that
   are defined in this document:

   1)  URI
       - printer-uri, printer-xri-supported, printer-more-info

       The UTF-8 encoding is forward compatible with any future
       deployment of (UTF-8 based) IRI (Internationalized Resource
       Identifiers) [W3C-IRI] currently being developed by the W3C
       Internationalization Working Group.

   2)  Description
       - printer-name, printer-location, printer-info,
       printer-make-and-model






Fleming &amp; McDonald           Informational                      [Page 3]

RFC 3712            LDAP Schema for Printer Services       February 2004


       The UTF-8 encoding supports descriptions in any language,
       conformant with the &quot;IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages&quot;
       [RFC2277].

       Note:  The printer-natural-language-configured attribute contains
       a language tag [RFC3066] for these description attributes (for
       example, to support text-to-speech conversions).

   3)  Keyword
       - printer-compression-supported, printer-finishings-supported,
       printer-media-supported, printer-media-local-supported,
       printer-print-quality-supported

       The UTF-8 encoding is compatible with the current IPP/1.1
       [RFC2911] definition of the equivalent attributes, most of which
       have the IPP/1.1 union syntax &#39;keyword or name&#39;.  The keyword
       attributes defined in this document are extensible by
       site-specific or vendor-specific &#39;names&#39; which behave like new
       &#39;keywords&#39;

       Note:  In IPP/1.1, each value is strongly typed over-the-wire as
       either &#39;keyword&#39; or &#39;name&#39;.  This union selector is not preserved
       in the definitions of these equivalent LDAP attributes.

1.2.  Rationale for using caseIgnoreMatch

   The EQUALITY matching rule &#39;caseIgnoreMatch&#39; defined in [RFC2252] is
   specified for several groups of string attributes that are defined in
   this document:

   1)  URI

       These URI attributes specify EQUALITY matching with
       &#39;caseIgnoreMatch&#39; (rather than with &#39;caseExactMatch&#39;) in order to
       conform to the spirit of [RFC2396], which requires case
       insensitive matching on the host part of a URI versus case
       sensitive matching on the remainder of a URI.

       These URI attributes follow existing practice of supporting case
       insensitive equality matching for host names in the
       associatedDomain attribute defined in [RFC1274].

       Either equality matching rule choice would be a compromise:
       a) case sensitive whole URI matching may lead to false negative
       matches and has been shown to be fragile (given deployed client
       applications that &#39;pretty up&#39; host names displayed and
       transferred in URI);




Fleming &amp; McDonald           Informational                      [Page 4]

RFC 3712            LDAP Schema for Printer Services       February 2004


       b) case insensitive whole URI matching may lead to false positive
       matches, although it is a dangerous practice to publish URI that
       differ only by case (for example, in the path elements).

   2)  Description

       Case insensitive equality matching is more user-friendly for
       description attributes.

   3)  Keyword

       Case insensitive equality matching is more user-friendly for
       keyword attributes.

1.3.  Rationale for using caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch

   The SUBSTR matching rule &#39;caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch&#39; defined in
   [RFC2252] is specified for several groups of string attributes that
   are defined in this document:

   1)  URI

       These URI attributes follow existing practice of supporting case
       insensitive equality matching for host names in the
       associatedDomain attribute defined in [RFC1274].

   2)  Description

       Support for case insensitive substring matching is more
       user-friendly for description attributes.

   3)  Keyword

       Support for case insensitive substring matching is more
       user-friendly for keyword attributes.

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

   Schema definitions are provided using LDAPv3 [LDAP-TS] description
   formats.  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for
   readability.

RFC 3712            LDAP Schema for Printer Services       February 2004


3.  Definition of Object Classes

   We define the following LDAP object classes for use with both generic
   printer related information and services specific to SLPv2 [RFC2608],
   IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], and LPR [RFC1179].

   slpServicePrinter - auxiliary class for SLP registered printers
   printerAbstract - abstract class for all printer classes
   printerService - structural class for printers
   printerServiceAuxClass - auxiliary class for printers
   printerIPP - auxiliary class for IPP printers
   printerLPR - auxiliary class for LPR printers

   The following are some examples of how applications may choose to use
   these classes when creating directory entries:

   1)  Use printerService for directory entries containing common
       printer information.

   2)  Use both printerService and slpServicePrinter for directory
       entries containing common printer information for SLP registered
       printers.

   3)  Use printerService, printerLPR and printerIPP for directory
       entries containing common printer information for printers that
       support both LPR and IPP.

   4)  Use printerServiceAuxClass and object classes not defined by this
       document for directory entries containing common printer
       information.  In this example, printerServiceAuxClass is used for
       extending other structural classes defining printer information
       with common printer information defined in this document.

   Refer to Section 4 for definition of attribute types referenced by
   these object classes.  We use attribute names instead of OIDs in
   object class definitions for clarity.  Some attribute names described
   in [RFC2911] have been prefixed with &#39;printer-&#39; as recommended in
   [RFC2926] and [SLP-PRT].

   This auxiliary class defines Service Location Protocol (SLPv2)
   [RFC2608] specific information.  It should be used with a structural
   class such as printerService.  It may be used to create new or extend
   existing directory entries with SLP &#39;service:printer&#39; abstract
   service type information as defined in [SLP-PRT].  This object class
   is derived from &#39;slpService&#39;, the parent class for all SLP services,
   defined in [RFC2926].

3.2.  printerAbstract

   )

   This abstract class defines printer information.  It is a base class
   for deriving other printer related classes, such as, but not limited
   to, classes defined in this document.  It defines a common set of
   printer attributes that are not specific to any one type of service,
   protocol or operating system.

   MAY   ( printer-uri $ printer-xri-supported )
   )

   This structural class defines printer information.  It is derived
   from class printerAbstract and thus inherits common printer
   attributes.  This class can be used with or without auxiliary classes
   to define printer information.  Auxiliary classes can be used to
   extend the common printer information with protocol, service or
   operating system specific information.

   Note:  When extending other structural classes with auxiliary
   classes, printerService should not be used.

3.4.  printerServiceAuxClass

   MAY   ( printer-uri $ printer-xri-supported )
   )

   This auxiliary class defines printer information.  It is derived from
   class printerAbstract and thus inherits common printer attributes.
   This class should be used with a structural class.

3.5.  printerIPP

   This auxiliary class defines Internet Printing Protocol (IPP/1.1)
   [RFC2911] information.  It should be used with a structural class
   such as printerService.  It is used to extend structural classes with
   IPP specific printer information.

3.6.  printerLPR

   ( 1.3.18.0.2.6.253

   MUST  ( printer-name )
   MAY   ( printer-aliases)
   )

   This auxiliary class defines LPR [RFC1179] information.  It should be
   used with a structural class such as printerService.  It is used to
   identify directory entries that support LPR.

4.  Definition of Attribute Types

   The following attribute types are referenced by the object classes
   defined in Section 3.

   The following attribute types reference syntax OIDs defined in
   Section 6 of [RFC2252] (see Section 5 &#39;Definition of Syntaxes&#39;
   below).

   The following attribute types reference matching rule names (instead
   of OIDs) for clarity (see Section 6 below).  For optional attributes,
   if the printer information is not known, the attribute value should
   not be set.  In the following definitions, referenced matching rules
   are defined in Section 8 of [RFC2252] and/or Section 2 of [RFC3698]
   (see Section 6 &#39;Definition of Matching Rules&#39; below).

   The following table is a summary of the attribute names defined by
   this document and their corresponding names from [RFC2911].  Some
   attribute names described in [RFC2911] have been prefixed with
   &#39;printer-&#39; as recommended in [RFC2926], to address the flat namespace
   for LDAP identifiers.

   If the printer-xri-supported LDAP attribute is implemented, then this
   printer-uri value should be listed in printer-xri-supported.

   Values of URI should conform to [RFC2396], although URI schemes may
   be defined which do not conform to [RFC2396] (see [RFC2717] and
   [RFC2718]).

   Note:  LDAP application clients should not attempt to use malformed
   URI values read from this attribute.  LDAP administrative clients
   should not write malformed URI values into this attribute.

   Note:  For SLP registered printers, the LDAP printer-uri attribute
   should be set to the value of the SLP-registered URL of the printer,
   for interworking with SLPv2 [RFC2608] service discovery.

   Note:  See Sections 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 for rationale for design
   choices.

   A list of XRI (extended resource identifiers) supported by this
   printer.  Each value of this list should consist of a URI (uniform
   resource identifier) followed by (optional) authentication and
   security fields.

   be defined which do not conform to [RFC2396] (see [RFC2717] and
   [RFC2718]).

   Note:  LDAP application clients should not attempt to use malformed
   URI values read from this attribute.  LDAP administrative clients
   should not write malformed URI values into this attribute.

   Note:  This attribute is based on &#39;printer-uri-supported&#39;, &#39;uri-
   authentication-supported&#39;, and `&#39;uri-security-supported&#39; (called the
   &#39;Three Musketeers&#39; because they are parallel ordered attributes)
   defined in IPP/1.1 [RFC2911].  This attribute unfolds those IPP/1.1
   attributes and thus avoids the ordering (and same number of values)
   constraints of the IPP/1.1 separate attributes.

   Defined keywords for fields include:

       &#39;uri&#39; (IPP &#39;printer-uri-supported&#39;)
       &#39;auth&#39; (IPP &#39;uri-authentication-supported&#39;)
       &#39;sec&#39; (IPP &#39;uri-security-supported&#39;)

   A missing &#39;auth&#39; field should be interpreted to mean &#39;none&#39;.  Per
   IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], defined values of the &#39;auth&#39; field include:

       &#39;none&#39; (no authentication for this URI)
       &#39;requesting-user-name&#39; (from operation request)
       &#39;basic&#39; (HTTP/1.1 Basic [RFC2617])
       &#39;digest&#39; (HTTP/1.1 Basic, [RFC2617])
       &#39;certificate&#39; (from certificate)

   A missing &#39;sec&#39; field should be interpreted to mean &#39;none&#39;.  Per
   IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], defined values of the &#39;sec&#39; field include:

       &#39;none&#39; (no security for this URI)
       &#39;ssl3&#39; (Netscape SSL3)
       &#39;tls&#39; (IETF TLS/1.0, [RFC2246])

   Each XRI field should be delimited by &#39;&lt;&#39;.  For example:

       &#39;uri=ipp://foo.com&lt; auth=digest&lt; sec=tls&lt;&#39;
       &#39;uri=lpr://bar.com&lt; auth=none&lt; sec=none&lt;&#39;
       &#39;uri=mailto:printer@foobar.com&lt; auth=none&lt; sec=none&lt;&#39;

   Note:  The syntax and delimiter for this attribute are aligned with
   the equivalent attribute in the &#39;service:printer:&#39; v2.0 template
   [SLP-PRT].  Whitespace is permitted after (but not before) the
   delimiter &#39;&lt;&#39;.  Note that this delimiter differs from printer-
   resolution-supported.

   Note:  See Sections 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 for rationale for design
   choices.

   )

   Values of this attribute should be specified in the language
   specified in printer-natural-language-configured (for example, to
   support text-to-speech conversions), although the printer&#39;s name may
   be specified in any language.  This name may be the last part of the
   printer&#39;s URI or it may be completely unrelated.  This name may
   contain characters that are not allowed in a conventional URI (see
   [RFC2396]).

   Also, a possible natural language for printer string attributes set
   by operator, system administrator, or manufacturer.  Also, the
   (declared) natural language of the printer-name, printer-location,
   printer-info, and printer-make-and-model attributes of this printer.

   Values of language tags should conform to &quot;Tags for the
   Identification of Languages&quot; [RFC3066].  For example:

       &#39;en-us&#39; (English as spoken in the US)
       &#39;fr-fr&#39; (French as spoken in France)

   For consistency with IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], language tags in this
   attribute should be lowercase normalized.

   For example, this could be an HTTP type URI referencing an HTML page
   accessible to a Web Browser.  The information obtained from this URI
   is intended for end user consumption.

   Values of URI should conform to [RFC2396], although URI schemes may
   be defined which do not conform to [RFC2396] (see [RFC2717] and
   [RFC2718]).

   Note:  LDAP application clients should not attempt to use malformed

   Each resolution value should be a string containing 3 fields:
   1)  Cross feed direction resolution (positive integer);
   2)  Feed direction resolution (positive integer);
   3)  Unit - &#39;dpi&#39; (dots per inch) or &#39;dpcm&#39; (dots per centimeter).

   Each resolution field should be delimited by &#39;&gt;&#39;.  For example:

       &#39;300&gt; 300&gt; dpi&gt;&#39;
       &#39;600&gt; 600&gt; dpi&gt;&#39;

   Note:  This attribute is based on &#39;printer-resolution-supported&#39;
   defined in IPP/1.1 [RFC2911] (which has a binary complex encoding)
   derived from &#39;prtMarkerAddressabilityFeedDir&#39;,
   &#39;prtMarkerAddressabilityXFeedDir&#39;, and &#39;prtMarkerAddressabilityUnit&#39;
   defined in the Printer MIB [RFC1759] (which have integer encodings).

   Note:  The syntax and delimiter for this attribute are aligned with
   the equivalent attribute in the &#39;service:printer:&#39; v2.0 template
   [SLP-PRT].  Whitespace is permitted after (but not before) the
   delimiter &#39;&gt;&#39;.  Note that this delimiter differs from printer-xri-
   supported.

8.  Internationalization Considerations

   All text string attributes defined in this document of syntax
   [RFC2279], as required by [RFC2252].

   A language tag [RFC3066] for all of the text string attributes
   defined in this document is contained in the printer-natural-
   language-configured attribute.

RFC 3712            LDAP Schema for Printer Services       February 2004


   Therefore, all object classes defined in this document conform to the
   &quot;IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages&quot; [RFC2277].

9.  Security Considerations

   See [RFC2829] for detailed guidance on authentication methods for
   LDAP.  See [RFC2830] for detailed guidance of using TLS/1.0 [RFC2246]
   to supply connection confidentiality and data integrity for LDAP
   sessions.

   As with any LDAP schema, it is important to protect specific entries
   and attributes with the appropriate access control.  It is
   particularly important that only administrators can modify entries
   defined in this LDAP printer schema.  Otherwise, an LDAP client might
   be fooled into diverting print service requests from the original
   printer (or spooler) to a malicious intruder&#39;s host system, thus
   exposing the information in printed documents.

   For additional security considerations of deploying printers in an
   IPP environment, see Section 8 of [RFC2911].
